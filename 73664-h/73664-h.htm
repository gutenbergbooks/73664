  <h3 class='c013'>PREFACE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>From the moment of beginning my work, one of
my most anxious endeavours has been to keep
myself out of the sight of my readers;—not from
any affectation of reserve, but because, in this case,
there is no necessary connexion between the author
of the work and the matter discussed in it.
Occasions have arisen, however, to induce me to
speak in the first person, in a preface; and I now
do so again on account of certain questions which
have been publicly as well as privately treated,
respecting the proper direction of the popular
influence which is attributed to me, and which it
would be equally weak and hypocritical in me to
disclaim.</p>

<p class='c001'>What I wish to explain is,—briefly,—that I
take my stand upon <span class='sc'>Science</span>. Whether the
truths attempted to be illustrated by me on this
ground be Tory, Whig, or Radical, is a question to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>be determined, if they so please, by Tories, Whigs,
and Radicals, and not (at least at present) by me.
It comes within the scope of my object to illustrate
certain principles of Social Morals, as well
as of Political Economy; but it is altogether
foreign to my purpose to determine by what
political party those principles are the most satisfactorily
recognized. I may have,—I have,—a
decided opinion on this point; but, as it has
nothing to do with my work, I must protest
against all attempts on the part of those who speak
of me as an author to render me distrusted by any
one political party, or to identify me with any
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>All have their mission. It is the mission of
some to lead or support a party;—a mission as
honourable as it is necessary. It is the mission of
others to ascertain or to teach truth which bears
no relation to party; and to fulfil it requires the
free use of materials and facilities afforded by any
in whose possession they may happen to be. This
last is my office,—imposed on me by the very act
of accepting my first services. Its discharge
requires perfect liberty of action and of speech;—freedom
alike from anger at the vituperation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>ridicule of one party,—from distrust of the
courtesies of a second,—and from subservience to
the dictation of a third. Such freedom I enjoy,
and am resolved to maintain. The sciences on
which I touch, whether in the one series or the
other on which I am occupied, bear no relation to
party. The People, for whom I write, are of no
party,—I, therefore, as a writer, am of no party.
To what party I might be proved to belong by
inference from the truths I illustrate, I leave to be
decided by those who may think it worth their
while.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this explanation should expose me to the
charge of self-importance, let it in justice be
remembered that it was not I who originated the
question respecting the proper direction of my
influence, or invited any interference therein.
No such direction is attempted by myself. As I
think, so I speak; leaving what I say to find its
way to the hearts and minds which have a congeniality
with my own. Whenever I begin to
modify the expression of what I think from a
regard to one class of minds rather than another,
I shall probably be thankful for assistance in
determining the direction of an influence which
will have lost half its vitality in losing its freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Meantime, while declining all control in the
use of such power as I have, I will most humbly
accept aid from any quarter in the improvement of
its character. With its extent and mode of operation
I am and shall be satisfied, because these are
not included in my responsibilities. With its
quality I hope never to be satisfied; as the time
ought never to arrive when it will not be inferior
to my aspirations.</p>

<hr class='c019'>

<h3 id='ch1.1' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br> <br> MIDSUMMER MOONLIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The nights of a certain summer of the present
century would scarcely have been known for
nights by those sober people who shut themselves
in as it grows dark, and look out in the
morning, perceiving only that the sun is come
again. During the nights we speak of, repose
did not descend with the twilight upon the black
moors of Yorkshire, and the moon looked down
upon something more glittering than the reflection
of her own face in the tarns of Ingleborough,
or in the reaches of the Wharf and the Don.
Some of the polished and sharpened ware of
Sheffield was exposed to the night dews in the
fields, and passed from the hands of those who
tempered to the possession of those who were to
wield it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Others were also abroad, with the view of
relieving their hardships instead of seeking to
avenge them. The dwellers on high grounds
were so far worse off than the inhabitants of the
valleys, that they could not quench their thirst,
and lose in sleep their weariness and their apprehensions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.02'>02</span>of hunger. During the day, there
was drought within, and the images of drought
without;—hay dried before it was mown; cattle
with their tongues hanging out, panting in the
parched meadows; horses lashing madly at the
clouds of flies that descended upon them as they
stooped to the slimy pools which had still some
moisture in them; wells with cracked buckets
and dangling ropes; and ditches where there was
an equally small probability that children would
find weeds and be drowned in the search. During
the night, when some of these spectacles were
hidden, it was necessary to take the chance of
preventing a repetition of them on the following
day; and those who had cattle growing lean,
children growing fretful, and no remaining patience
with a dry well, bore with the weariness
of night-watching in the hope of relieving the
more urgent evil of thirst.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the night when the midsummer full moon
gradually emerged from the partial eclipse caused
by the smokes of Sheffield, and shone full on the
hill-sides to the west, two women were sitting
near a spring which had rarely, till lately, failed
to bless the stony region in which it was wont to
flow. They came to watch for any gush or drip
which might betoken the fall of showers somewhere
among the hills; and patient would their
watch have appeared to an observer. The one
sat on the stone fence which separated the road
from a field of drooping oats, and never moved,
except to cast a frightened look around her when
an unseasonable bleat proceeded from the restless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.03'>03</span>ewes on the moor, or the distant foundry
clock was heard to strike. Her companion sat,
also in silence, on the edge of the dry cistern
where her pitcher rested, and kept her eyes fixed
on the fitful lights of the foundry from whose
neighbourhood she had come.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have been thinking, Mary,” said Mrs. Kay,
leaving her seat on the wall, and speaking in a
low voice to her sister-in-law,—“I have been
thinking that my husband may, perhaps, come
round for us when his hours are up at the foundry,
instead of going straight home. I wish he
may; for I declare I don’t like being out in this
way, all by ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary made no answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is all so still and unnatural here. There’s
the foundry at work, to be sure; but to see the
tilting-mill standing, all black and quiet, is
what I never met with before. We may see it
for some time to come, though; for there seems
little chance of a sufficient fall to touch the wheel
at present. Do you think there is, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary shook her head; and Mrs. Kay, having
examined the spring with eye and ear, stole back
to her former seat.</p>

<p class='c001'>After looking into the field behind her for
some time, she came again to say,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My husband talks about the crops, and the
harvest being at hand, and so on; but I do not
see what sort of a harvest it is to be, unless we
have rain directly. What a poor-looking oat-field
that is behind the wall! and there are none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.04'>04</span>any better on these high grounds, as far as I can
see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There would be some chance for the low
grounds, if the springs would flow,” answered
Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, yes. My husband was telling me
that there is a corner left of one of Anderson’s
meadows down below, where the grass is as fresh
and sweet as if there had been forty-eight hours’
rain. It was but a corner; but there was one of
the little Andersons, and his sister, raking up the
grass after the mower, and piling their garden
barrow with it, to give to their white pony. Even
Anderson’s beasts have been foddered, as if it was
winter, for this fortnight past.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary nodded, and her sister proceeded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder how many more improvements of
Anderson’s we shall see after this next bad harvest;
for bad it must be now. It seems to me
that the less his land yields, the more he lays out
upon it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The less it yields, the more he wants, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but it is an accident its yielding so ill
for three years together; and where he gets the
money, I don’t know, except that bread has been
dear enough of late to pay for any thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s it, to be sure,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dear enough for any thing,” repeated Mrs.
Kay. “When I used to have my fill of meat
every day, I little thought that the bread I ate
with it would grow scarce among us. No rise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.05'>05</span>of wages, such as the masters make such a complaint
of, can stand against it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary shook her head, and there was a long
pause.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll tell you what, Mary,” resumed the chief
speaker, after a time, “there would be much
more pleasure in talking with you, if you would
talk a little yourself. It sets one down so not to
know whether you are listening to what one
says.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I always listen when I am spoken to,” replied
Mary; “but people are not all made
talkers alike.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, no, that they certainly are not. My
husband laughs, and says that a pretty dull time
you and Chatham must have of it, when you are
out walking on Sundays. You will both get all
you want to say in a week said in five minutes.
Well, I don’t wonder at your not answering
that; but you will not be offended at a joke from
your own brother; and you know he does not
think the worse of Chatham for keeping his
thoughts to himself, and——Mercy! what did I
see over yonder!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And in her hurry Mrs. Kay pushed the pitcher,
which Mary caught before it went rattling down
among the stones. She sat very quietly, watching
the motions of a number of men who were
crossing a gate from one field to another at some
distance, and who seemed to be making for the
road.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mary! Mary! what shall we do if they
come here?” asked the trembling Mrs. Kay.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.06'>06</span>Mary rose and took up her pitcher, observing
that they might sit safe enough in the shadow of
Warden’s mill, just to the left; and then they
might have another chance for the spring as they
came by in their way home. Mrs. Kay could
scarcely be persuaded that going home would be
perfectly safe as soon as it was daylight, and
that the men who had evidently been out at drill
would be dispersed by dawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>The women crept along, under the shadow of
the wall, and then quickly crossed the broad
strip of moonlight which lay between them and
the mill. Before they reached the steps, which
happened to be on the shadowy side, Mrs. Kay
was nearly unable to walk, and her terrors were
not lessened by the apparition of a person standing
on the first stage, and looking down on them
from the top of the long flight of steps.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sit still,” said Mary, beginning to ascend,
till she saw that Warden, the miller, was coming
down to inquire their business. She then briefly
explained what brought them upon his property.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you are looking for water,” he replied,
“and I am looking for wind. For three weeks
there has not been a breath, and not a steady
breeze since long before that. The bakers are
calling out upon us so as to keep us out of our
beds, watching for any rack in the sky that may
betoken a coming wind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And have you ever seen, sir, such a sight as
sent us here?” inquired the trembling Mrs. Kay.
<a id='corr6.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘Such'>“Such</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_6.32'><ins class='correction'>“Such</ins></a></span> a sight as there is in the fields there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, the nightly drill? O yes, many a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.07'>07</span>night, though they may not be aware who has
been overlooking them. They have never come
near enough on light nights for me to pick them
out by their faces, so that there is no occasion
for me to take any notice; but I mark how they
get on in shouldering their pikes and learning to
obey orders. Here, as I stand by the fan-wheel,
I hear the word of command quite plain through
the still air; and once they came upon this very
slope. It was too dark a night for them to see
me; but I heard them stumble against the very
steps you are sitting on, Mrs. Kay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How long do you suppose it is to last, Mr.
Warden?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Till prices fall, or the people have burned
a mill or two, perhaps. ’Tis a happy thing for
you and yours, Mrs. Kay, that Oliver’s foundry
does not come under the ban. There it blazes
away, night and day, and I hear no curses upon
it, like what are visited upon the mills. It is well
for you and yours that Kay has to ladle molten
metal instead of having to manage machinery. I
hope he is well, Mrs. Kay?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Kay did not answer, and was found to be
in no condition for dialogue. Fear and fatigue
had overpowered her, and she could only lean,
faint and sobbing, against the rail.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is not strong,” observed Mary. “Do
you happen to have any thing in the mill to revive
her? My pitcher is empty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Warden fanned her with his hat, having no
other means of refreshment in his power; and he
carried on the conversation with Mary while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.08'>08</span>doing so, that the poor woman might have time
to recover herself. It was not merely machinery
that was the object of the trained bands, he observed.
In many parts they had pulled down
corn stores; and it was rumoured that Kirkland’s
granaries were threatened by the very people who
were now near them. If they really entertained
the idea that it was a public injury to have a stock
of corn laid by while the price was high, it was
no wonder that they were angry with Kirkland,
as well as with some people that had much more
credit, without having done and suffered so much
to get it. He should like to know what the
country was to do without such men as Kirkland,
when there had been three bad harvests following
one another?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your mill would stand idle if there was not
corn brought from here or there,” observed
Mary. “But are those people that we saw
bound for Kirkland’s granaries? I should be
sorry to think that they were about any mischief.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They could be about little but mischief at
this time of night, and with arms too; but it is
full late, I fancy, to be going so far. It is said my
father-in-law’s threshing-machine is doomed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what does he say to that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, he swears at the people because they can’t
be contented when he is. But, to my mind, it
would not be so great a hardship this year as
another, seeing how little corn there will be to
thresh. Not that I approve such doings in any
way; but when people are so badly off with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.09'>09</span>high price of provisions, and the uncertainty of
peace, what can you expect?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You talked of noting faces; are there any
of our people now in yonder fields, do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you mean Sheffield people, or people of
your village?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, either.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are undoubtedly many from about
Stockport, and out of Leicestershire, who go the
round to stir up discontent, and teach the drill.
But it is said there are a good many neighbours
of ours among them too. What is more likely
than that those who have not had their fill in the
day should turn out at night to something that
may amuse them better than lying awake, or
dreaming of cheap bread? This is just what
you have been doing, you see; and what Mrs.
Kay had better have let alone, it seems. Come,
Mrs. Kay, how are you now? Able to walk, do
you think?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite able now to walk, and to ask a hundred
questions on the way about the cause of the terror
which had shaken her, and the probable duration
of the hardship which had reduced her; on
neither of which matters was much satisfaction to
be gained from the miller.</p>

<p class='c001'>The spring was still dry, but Mary chose to
watch till the children came to take her place in
the morning. The miller took charge of Mrs.
Kay till she was fairly within the light of the
foundry fires, and then struck across the fields
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.10'>10</span>homewards, hoping that his mill would not again
be the refuge of frightened women while he was
on the spot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary’s watch was vain, and the more wearisome
from her occasional fancy that it would not
prove vain. More than once she was persuaded
that she heard the trickling of water while listening
intently after the moon had gone down; and
when she fell asleep for a few moments, her
thoughts were full of the hardship of having only
one pitcher to fill when the water was overflowing
every place. Not the less for this did she
carry home this very pitcher, swinging empty at
arm’s length, when the village was up and awake,
and the sun beating down hot upon the slippery
turf, and glaring, reflected from the stone fences,
upon the dusty road.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the door she met a neighbour, Mrs. Skipper,
the baker of the village, who supplied a use
for the pitcher.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Mary Kay, and what’s the news with
you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing particular, Mrs. Skipper. Are you
come to tell us again that bread is risen?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, that I am, I’m sorry to say; and I
wish you would change looks with me, Mary,
and then people would not taunt me as they do,
when I say that bread has risen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How would that alter the matter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, they talk about my being fresh-coloured,
and all that, and say it’s a sign that I live of the
best, whatever I may charge to others. Just as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.11'>11</span>if I made the bread dear, instead of the corn being
as high to us bakers as to other people; and as
if there was no assize of bread in London.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And as if you cared for being called handsome,”
added Kay from behind, having come to
breakfast in the midst of the greeting.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think you are handsome—very handsome,”
said little John Kay, looking up earnestly into
Mrs. Skipper’s bonny face. She stooped down to
give him a hearty smack, and promise him a half-penny
bun if he would come and see her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There now, master John, you well nigh
made me spill my cider, boy. Here, Mary, hold
your pitcher. Yes, it is for you—for all of you,
I mean. You will give John a drop, I’m sure.
Ah! I thought you would like it, now it is so
difficult to get any thing good to drink. Do but
taste it, Mr. Kay. Is not it good? It was sent
me by a cousin of mine, and I thought I would
bring you some, especially as I had to tell you
that the bread is risen again. It is nineteen-pence
now! What do you say to that, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary, as usual, said nothing. She did not
find that speech mended matters of this kind;
and besides, it was time she was setting about
her task of purifying the distasteful water which
they must drink, if they meant to drink at all,
till the springs should flow again. She emptied
the clear, fresh-looking cider into her own
pitcher, and returned Mrs. Skipper’s with a look
which was less indifferent than her manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What I say is,” observed Kay, “that if
bread is risen, our wages must rise. We are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.12'>12</span>of one mind about that—that a man cannot live
for less than will keep him alive; to say nothing
of his being fresh-coloured, Mrs. Skipper. We
can none of us boast much of that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, how’s your wife, Mr. Kay? She was
but poorly, I thought, when I saw her two days
ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, she is a poor thing enough. She was
not much to boast of when she had an easy life
compared with the present; and now she droops
sadly. John can hardly call her very handsome
indeed. Can you, John?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“John, carry your mother a cup of cider, if
she is awake,” said Mary; “and tell her I am
home, getting breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, that’s right, Mary,” said Mrs. Skipper.
“You have such a way of telling giddy
people what they should not say and do. I am
going my ways directly, to leave you to yours.
But send one of the children after me for a nice
hot roll for your sister. The new bread is just
coming out of the oven. And be sure you tell
me whether she likes the cider, you know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if she has not an appetite for the roll,
we won’t send it back, I promise you,” said Kay.
“She has got into the way of not touching her
breakfast, lately; and the same thing cannot be
said of me, when I have been busy casting all
night. Somebody will eat your roll, and thank
you for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That means that I may send two; but——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kay protested, and Mrs. Skipper explained,
and Mary announced breakfast.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.13'>13</span>“Breakfast, such as it is, Mrs. Skipper,” observed
Kay. “No disrespect to your bread! But
time was when I could afford it newer, and plenty
of it, and a bit of something to relish it. One
does not relish it so well when one can’t cut and
come again, but may have just so much and no
more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Skipper wished he could see what she
saw of poor creatures that could get none,—not
the smallest and driest loaf, to try whether they
could relish it. If the potato crop failed, she did
not know what was to become of them; or of
herself either, if they went on to look in at her
shop window. She had not the heart to draw the
bread, with them looking on, and not stuff a bit
into the children’s mouths. And, dashing away
the tears from her bright black eyes, widow
Skipper hastened whence she came, hugging by
the way the child who was sent to wait her
pleasure about the roll.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before sitting down to his scanty meal, Kay
went to rally his wife about what she had seen
and been alarmed at in her late expedition, and
to advise her to cheer up, instead of giving way,
as she seemed disposed now to do. She was up,
but he supposed hardly awake yet; for she had
not much to say, and seemed flurried, and not
able to take exactly what he meant. He thought
she had better have slept another hour.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1.14'>14</span>
  <h3 id='ch1.2' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span><br> <br> A HARVEST EVE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Mary rightly believed that there was a chance
for the corn on the low grounds, if rain should
speedily fall. By the time that the horned sheep
of the western moors had cropped the last bite of
juicy grass in the dells, they were gathered
together by the shepherd to abide the storms
which were gathering about the summits of
Wharnside and Pennygant. While they stood
trembling and bleating in the rising blasts, the
cattle in the vales left the muddy pools, and
turned towards the shelter of the stooping and
rustling trees; and many a human eye was raised
to the whirling mills, whose inactivity had wearied
expectation so long.</p>

<p class='c001'>Neither the wind, nor the rain which followed,
pleased every body, any more than any other
wind and rain. Havoc was made by the blasts
in Mr. Fergusson’s young plantations, where a
thousand saplings stood, dry enough for firewood,
ready to be snapped by the first visitation of a
gust. Trees of loftier growth strewed the Abbey
lawn, and afforded matter of lamentation to the
elder members of Mr. Fergusson’s family, and of
entertainment to the children, who watched for
hours the operations of the woodmen in removing
the fallen ornaments of the estate. Every
washerwoman within some miles who happened
to be pursuing her vocation that day, had to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.15'>15</span>mourn the disappearance of cap or handkerchief
from the line or bush; and how many kitchen
chimneys smoked, no chimney doctor near would
have ventured to say. Meanwhile, the millers
and their men bestirred themselves cheerily, as
sailors do when the breeze freshens after a long
calm; and careful housewifes dislodged all unclean
insects from their water tubs, and swept
out their spouts in preparation for the first droppings.
As might have been expected, the rain
came, not in droppings, but in sheets. No woollen
coat, woven or unwoven, saved the shepherd and
his sheep from being drenched to the skin. Every
tree became a commodious shower-bath to the
horse or cow beneath it. Many an infirmity was
exposed in thatch or tile which had never before
been suspected; and everybody looked gloomy
in Anderson’s farm, (except the ducks,) from the
apprehension that the meagre crops would be
laid, past recovery. On the first cessation of the
storm, matters did appear sad enough: in the
villages, every thing smutted, from the smoke of
the furnaces being beaten down; in the country,
all brown and muddy-looking till the waters had
had time to retire into the ditches, and the verdure
to show itself; and even then, the straggling oats
and prostrate wheat presented but a small improvement
on their former appearance. Landlords
and tenants crossed each other’s path while
taking their rounds, but could not agree as to the
probabilities of the approaching harvest. Mr.
Fergusson hoped that a day or two would make
a great difference in the appearance of the fields;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.16'>16</span>while Anderson was certain that it was too late
for the crops to revive under the gentlest rain,
and that they would prove to have been utterly
destroyed by the flood which had swept down
from the hills. Neither could establish his point
till harvest came.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then each proved to be right. On the high
grounds, the produce was, in truth, scarcely worth
carrying away, while in the vales there was better
work for the harvest wain. Even there, however,
there were more gleaners than reapers; and
the artisans who came forth in the evening to
see what had been done, agreed with the disappointed
Irish, who must travel farther in search
of harvest work, that the total crop would indeed
turn out to be far below the average.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best of the harvest fields did not present
the usual images of peace and contentment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Out, out, out!” cried Anderson, to a troop
of boys and girls who had pressed in at his heels
as he entered a field whence the sheaves were not
yet carried. “How many times am I to have the
trouble of turning you out, I wonder? Wait,
can’t ye, till the corn is carried?”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the flourish of his stick, the intruders took
flight, and jostled each other at the gate, in their
hurry to get out; but they returned, one by one,
keeping in his rear, like a spider watching a fly,
till they could stoop down behind a shock, and
filch from the sheaves at their leisure. Following
the example of the children, a woman dropped in
at the gate, another entered from a gap in the
fence, at a moment when the farmer had his back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.17'>17</span>turned, while the heads of two or three men appeared
over the wall. It was plain that the tenth
commandment was not in the thoughts of any
present, unless in Anderson’s own.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here again, you rogue!” he cried, lifting
up a boy by the collar from a hiding-place between
two sheaves. “You are the very boy I told
twice to go to the field below. There is plenty
of room for you there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there is no corn there, sir.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Corn or no corn, there you shall go to be
made an example of for pilfering from my
sheaves. Here, Hoggets, take this lad down to
the Lane field, and give him a good whipping in
sight of them all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, no, no! Mercy, mercy!” cried the boy.
“Mother said I should have no supper,—father
said he would beat me, if I did not make a
good gleaning. I won’t go, I tell you; I won’t.
O, sir, don’t let him beat me! Ask father! I
won’t go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary Kay came up to intercede. The boy
was her nephew; and she could assure Mr.
Anderson that John was told to go home at his
peril without an apron full of corn.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then let his parents answer for his flogging,
as they ought to do, for driving the boy to steal,”
said the farmer. “I am not to be encroached
upon because they choose to be harsh with their
boy; and I tell you, mistress, this pilfering must
be put a stop to. This very season, when the
crop is scanty enough at the best, I am losing
more than I ever did before by foul gleaning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.18'>18</span>Let the boy’s parents be answerable for the flogging
he shall have. Hoggets, take him away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Had you not better send Hoggets to flog the
boy’s father and mother?” Mary inquired.
“That would be more just, I think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, do, sir, do!” entreated John; “and I will
show him the way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I dare say you would; and this aunt of yours
would find some excuse next for their not being
flogged.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I won’t promise but I might,” said Mary;
“for they may have something to say about
what has driven them to covet your corn.
It is not the going without one supper, but the
being supperless every night. Instead of a beating,
once and away, such as they promised the
poor lad, it is the scourge of want, sir, for week
after week, and month after month.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am very sorry to hear it; and if they come
and ask in a proper way, they may chance to get
some help from me. But, as to countenancing
my property being taken because they are poor,
it would, be a sin for their boy’s sake, and for the
sake of all the boys that would follow his example.
So, off with him!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary was far from wishing to defend the act
of pilfering from sheaves, and equally far from
supposing that her brother and sister thought of
any such mode of fulfilling their command when
it was delivered to their boy. Mr. Anderson
might be perfectly sure that Kay and his wife
would not come and ask, in the “proper way” he
alluded to, for what they were wearing themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.19'>19</span>out in struggling to earn; and as for the boy,
she believed she could answer for him that the
being deprived of what he had gathered, or, at
most, a private beating, would avail to make him
observe other commands in endeavouring to fulfil
those of his parents. Anderson still thought
differently; and, perceiving at the moment half a
dozen little heads peeping from behind so many
shocks, was confirmed in his opinion that the boy
must be flogged. Hoggets accordingly whipped up
the little lad, slung him, screaming and writhing,
over his shoulder, and disappeared behind the
wall, while the farmer hunted out the other
culprits, and sent them, for a punishment, to see
their companion flogged in the field. Mary first
detained them to see her restore John’s handfulls
of corn to the sheaves, and then went down
to do the best she could for her poor little nephew
in his agony.</p>

<p class='c001'>She presently overtook him, and found that his
agony was now of a more mixed character than
she had expected. He was alternating between
hope and fear. The quivering nostril and short
sob told what his terror had been, while his raised
eye, and efforts to compose himself, testified to
his trust that he had found a deliverer. Two
young ladies on horseback were talking with
Hoggets, and looking compassionately on the
culprit, while Hoggets touched his hat every
instant, and had already lowered the boy from his
disgraceful elevation. The Miss Fergussons only
asked him to delay till they had overtaken Mr.
Anderson, and endeavoured to procure pardon;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.20'>20</span>and Hoggets thought it was not for him to resist
the wishes of the ladies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole matter was argued over again, and
the farmer strongly urged with the plea that corn
was more tempting to the poor than ever before,—the
quartern being now one shilling and eight-pence.
The farmer thought that the stronger
the temptation, the more exemplary should be
the punishment. If he could supply every bread-eater
near him with abundance of corn, so as to
obviate the temptation, he would gladly do so, as
he held prevention to be better than punishment;
but, as he had not this in his power, the best thing
he could do was to discourage compliance with
temptation. In this case, however, as the boy
had been a good deal punished by exposure, and
by being off and on in his expectations of being
flogged, enough was done for example, and John
might run home as fast as he liked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That will not be very fast,” Mary observed,
“since he is to be beaten at the end of his walk for
bringing his mother’s apron home empty. I have
heard say, sir, by one that knows well, that our
people are treated like this boy; brought low for
want of food, driven to skulk and pilfer for it, and
then disgraced and punished. But there is this
difference, that you cannot prevent the want,
and, in the case of the people, it might be prevented.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Chatham put that into your head, I suppose.
It is just like one of his sayings. But I wish he
would not make the worst of matters, as if any
thing ailed the nation more than there has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.21'>21</span>ever since people herded together with mischief-makers
among them here and there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Fergusson hoped that there had not
always been, and would not always be, such
proceedings as some which were going on now.
The coppice field had been green and smooth as
velvet the evening before, and this morning at
daybreak it was brown and trampled. The
skulkers and meditators of violence had been
there; and the records of her father’s justice-room
would show that the disgrace and punishment
spoken of by Mary were fast following the destitution
which is the cause of crime. She hoped
Mr. Anderson did not suppose that this was the
natural state in which people will always live,
while congregating for the sake of the advantages
of society.</p>

<p class='c001'>Anderson hoped that men would grow wiser in
time than to set up midnight drills as a remedy
for the distress which always occurs from time to
time; and then Mr. Fergusson would have less
disagreeable justice-work to do. The ladies
believed that the shortest way to obviate the folly
would be to obviate the distress; and, as they
moved on, were recommended to pray for a better
harvest than had this year blessed the land.</p>

<p class='c001'>John had stolen away in advance of their
horses. Finding that they were proceeding to
join their brothers, who had been grouse-shooting
in the moors since daybreak, it occurred to the
poor boy that by following in the track of the
gentlemen, he might chance to pick up something
which would serve as a propitiation at home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.22'>22</span>for his failure in the article of corn. It was possible
that a wounded bird or two might have been
left by the sportsmen, and that those who could
not purchase bread might sup off game:—no
uncommon occurrence in a country where the
tenants of a preserve are better fed than the
inhabitants of a village. Half resolving to try
his fortune on the other side the hills, and never
to face his parents again unless he could find a
black cock, John plunged into the moors, keeping
the ladies in view from a distance, as a sort of
guide to the track that the sportsmen had been
pursuing. He had not speed of foot to sustain,
for any length of time, his share of the race.
The riding party disappeared in the dusk; no
living thing crossed his path, but many inanimate
ones put on the appearance of a fluttering bird to
deceive the agitated and hungry boy; and the
breeze which stirred them did not cool his brow.
He could nowhere find a pool of water from
which he might drink. His legs bent under him;
and at the thought of how far they must yet carry
him before he could reach shelter, north, south,
east, or west, he began to cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tears do not flow long when they may flow
freely. It is the presence of restraint, or the interruption
of thought, causing the painful idea to
recur, which renders it difficult for a child to
stop a fit of crying. John had no such restraint,
and was subject to no further interruption than
the silent appearance of light after light in the
village below, and the survey of an occasional
sheep, which came noiselessly to look at him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.23'>23</span>walk away again. By the time that the dew began
to make itself felt upon his face, he was
yawning instead of crying; and he rose from the
turf as much from a desire to be moving again
as from any anxiety as to what was to become
of him this night. A manifold bleat resounded
as he erected himself, and a score or two of sheep
ran over one another as he moved from his resting
place, giving hope that the shepherd was at
no great distance. It was not long before he
was seen through the grey twilight, moving on
a slope a little to the west; and, to John’s delight,
he turned out to be an acquaintance, Bill
Hookey, who lived close by the Kays till he went
upon the moors in Wilkins the grazier’s service.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How late are you going to be out, Will?”
was John’s first question.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As late as it be before it is early,” replied
Will. “Yon’s my sleeping place, and I am
going to turn in when I have made out what is
doing on the river there. Look farther down,—below
the forge, boy. They are quiet enough
this minute, or the wind is lulled. When it
blows again, you may chance to hear what I
heard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But about sleeping,” said John. “I am
mortally tired, and I’ve a great way to go home.
Can’t you give me a corner in your hut till
morning?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, I doubt there will be scarce room, for
I promised two of my ewes that they should
have shelter to-night; and this lamb is too tender,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.24'>24</span>you see, to be left to itself. I don’t see how
they can let you be served.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John promised to let the ewes have the first
choice of a snug corner, and to be content with
any space they might leave him, explaining that
he wanted to be abroad early to glean, and that
it would save him a long walk to sleep on this
side Anderson’s fields, instead of a mile to the
east of them. He said nothing at present about
his hunger, lest it should prove an objection to
his abiding in Will’s company. The objection
came spontaneously, however, into the mind of
the prudent Will.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope you’ve your supper with you, lad, or
you’ll fare hardly here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, never mind supper,” said John, brushing
his sleeve across his eyes. “I have gone without
often enough lately.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Like many a one besides. Well, if you
don’t mind supper, so much the better for you.
I have left but a scanty one for myself, I was so
mortal hungry at dinner time; and there is no
more bread and milk in the jar than the lamb
will want.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Can’t I get some fresh sweet grass for the
lamb that will do as well? Do let me! Pretty
creature! I should like to feed it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The offer was scornfully declined, and he was
told that he might help any of the older lambs to
graze, but that he must, at his peril, touch this
particularly precious, newly-dropped lamb. John
was more disposed to graze on his own account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.25'>25</span>than to assist any creature in eating what he
could not share. It next occurred to him to propose
a bargain. He thought it promised to be
a cold night. Will agreed that it might be middlingly
so. John had his mother’s stout apron
with him, and Will should be welcome to it to
wrap the lamb in, if John might have some of the
lamb’s bread and milk. Will had, however, a
provokingly comfortable woollen wrapper, one
end of which was always at the service of the pet
lamb for the time being. While the next mode
of attack was being devised, the soft pacing of
horses’ feet on the turf, and the occasional striking
of a hoof against a flint, were heard; and
Will, offering an obeisance which was lost in
the darkness, made bold to inquire what sport the
gentlemen had had on the moors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Excellent sport, if we had bagged as many as
we brought down,” answered one of the youths:
“but thieves seem to be as plentiful as furze-bushes
hereabouts. There were so many loiterers
about our steps that our dogs could not move
quick enough when we brought down more than
one bird at a time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There will be a savoury supper or two eaten
to-night by those who sport without pulling a
trigger,” observed the other Mr. Fergusson.
“But they are welcome to my share of the
powder and shot they have helped themselves
to.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John’s heart swelled at the thoughts of how
he should like to be a sportsman after this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.26'>26</span>fashion, especially as the gentleman declared that
he should have been welcome.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ladies had paused to listen to another such
sound from afar as Will had described. Many
of the twinkling lights from the village had disappeared,
and there seemed to be a great bustle
below the forge, displayed as often as the big
bellows exerted themselves to throw out a peculiarly
vivid flame to light up the banks of the
river. Will was of opinion that the people were
in a hurry for their corn, and unwilling to await
Kirkland’s time for opening his granaries, and
unlading his lighters. There had been talk,—as
he had overheard on the moors,—of going
down the river to where the lighters took in their
cargoes, and demanding the distribution of the
corn upon the spot. Probably this was what
was now being done at Kirkland’s, instead of a
few miles nearer the river’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is time we were off, if that be the case,”
cried one of the gentlemen. “Kirkland must
not be borne down in this manner, for the people’s
sake any more than for his own. Come,
Charles. The girls will be safe enough with
Jackson. Let us run down to the village.
Here, little boy! You know Anderson’s? You
know Mr. Anderson himself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>John hung down his head, and acknowledged
that he knew Mr. Anderson.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, here is a shilling for you. Run to
Mr. Anderson, and beg him from me to come
down, with his steadiest men, if he has any, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.27'>27</span>Kirkland’s premises, as fast as possible. Off with
you! What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he should be gone already, sir?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, then, go and call your father, if your
father is not an ass, like the rest of the people
hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John heard one of the young ladies check her
brother for his expression, reminding him that
nothing makes the ears grow so fast as the having
an empty stomach; and the boy pondered
for a moment whether his father’s ears had
lengthened since the time when the family had
become subject to hunger. His hand involuntarily
went up to the side of his own head; and
then came the speculation whether he should
offer Will a high price for the lamb’s bread and
milk on the spot, or wait to change his shilling
at Mrs. Skipper’s counter. A sharp rebuke from
his employer for his delay sent him bounding
down the slope, calling up his courage to face
the farmer, and consoling himself with thoughts
of real white bread, dispensed under Mrs. Skipper’s
bright smile.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alas! Mrs. Skipper had no bright smile, this
evening, even for John; much less for any one
who had not so decided an opinion about her
being very handsome. Anderson had looked
full as grave as John expected, whether about
the matter in hand, or the boy’s past offence,
was not clear; but the farmer’s gravity was nothing
to Mrs. Skipper’s terror. She scolded
everybody about her, ran from one neighbour to
another for advice whether to barricade her windows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.28'>28</span>and could by no means attend to John’s
demand of a penny roll till he was on the point
of helping himself; and, slipping the shilling
into the till, Mrs. Skipper huffed him when he
asked for change, and turned her back upon him
so as to make him fear that he had made a more
costly bargain, after all, than if he had bid for
the lamb’s bread and milk upon the moor. All
this was not without cause. A friendly neighbour
had come up from the river-side to warn
her that it had been proposed by the people assembled
round Kirkland’s granaries, that, failing
a supply of food from his stores, the hungry
should help themselves out of the baker’s shop.
It seemed but too probable that the threat would
be executed; for Mrs. Skipper found (and God
forgive her, she said, for being sorry to hear it!)
that Kirkland was prepared for the attack; having
thrown open two granaries to show that
they were empty, and promised that he had
something particular to say about the wheat on
board the lighters; something which was likely
to send the people away as hungry as they came.</p>

<p class='c001'>A champion soon appeared in the person of
Kay, who was almost the only man of the village
who was not engaged on the more important
scene of alarm. Women came in plenty, and
children stood, like scouts, in the distance; but
the women were found to be very poor comforters,
and the children ran away as often as
they were wanted for messengers. Mary was
there; and her indifference to the danger served
almost as well as Kay’s promised valour to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.29'>29</span>restore spirits to Mrs. Skipper. It was something
to do when the most valuable part of the
stock was carried away to be hidden in some
safe place, and the oldest loaves ostentatiously
placed so as to be stolen first, to taunt Mary
with her not caring for what happened to her
friends, and looking as indifferent as if she came
merely to buy a threepenny loaf. Mary made
no reply; but her brother declared that he must
just say for her, that if she was indifferent about
other people’s concerns, so she was about her
own. There was Chatham, very busy down by
the river-side, with everybody listening to him
but the one who had the most reason to be proud
to hear what he said; and Mrs. Skipper would
see, when she was cool, that it was rather hard
to scold Mary for being better able to give assistance
than if she was subject to being heated like
some people. Mrs. Skipper begged a world of
pardons. She was not half good enough for
Mary to care at all about her, and she was ready
to bite her tongue out for what she had said. As
Mary did not intimate any wish to this effect,
however, no such catastrophe took place, and
the necessary disposition of affairs proceeded
quietly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Skipper had not to wait long to know
her fate. Chatham came to tell her that the
people had been exasperated by finding that there
was no good corn for them on Kirkland’s premises,
and had gone on towards Sheffield, to
burn or pull down a mill or two, it was supposed,
as some faces well known at the midnight drill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.30'>30</span>were seen among them. If the few who remained
behind should come and ask bread of
Mrs. Skipper, he advised her to give it without
any show of unwillingness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mercy on me! that will be hard work, if
they look beyond the bread on the counter,—two
days old,” cried Mrs. Skipper. “Suppose
they should get at the dough, what am I to do
to-morrow? And the flour! There has not
been time to hide half the flour! They will
want to cut my head off every day for a week to
come, if they strip me of my flour, and expect
me to go on baking at the same price. O, Mr.
Kay, what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do as dealers in corn in another shape have
done, often and often,” replied Chatham.
“Bear your lot patiently as a dealer in that
which the people want most, and in which they
are most stinted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Skipper looked doubtfully at Mary for
a further explanation of what it was that she
was to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you mean,” asked Kay, “that they
have stripped Kirkland of his corn, and expect
him to sell more next week at the same price?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They would have done so, if Kirkland had
had much wheat to part with. The trade of a
corndealer, I have heard him and others say, has
always been a hard one to carry on. All parties
have joined against them, for as long a time as
can be remembered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay; the farmers are jealous, I suppose, of
their coming between them and the people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.31'>31</span>thinking they could get better prices if there was
nobody to be served between them and their customers.
And the people, in the same way, think
that they must pay higher for their bread, to enable
the corndealers to live.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Forgetting that the farmers have something
else to be doing than buying and selling corn,
here and there, wherever it is wanted, and getting
it from abroad when there is not enough at home,
and government lets more come in. But it is not
only the farmers and the people. The government
used to punish the buying up of corn where
it was plentiful, and selling it where it was scarce.
Many a corndealer has been punished instead of
thanked for doing this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not see why any man need be thanked
for doing what answers best to his own pocket,
as it certainly does to buy cheap and sell dear.
But to punish a man for coming between the
people and want, seems to me to be more like an
idle tale than anything to be believed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kirkland’s father was taken up and tried for
doing this very thing, not longer ago than a
dozen years or so. The law was against him,
(one of the old laws that we are learning to be
ashamed of;) but it was too clear that he had
done no harm, for anybody to wish that he
should be punished. So they let him go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who told you this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kirkland himself told us so, just now. He
said he had rather be brought to his trial in the
same way, than have the people take the matter
into their own hands to their own injury. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.32'>32</span>thought it was very brave of him to say so at
the moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why? Were the people angry?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Like to tear him to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And he within their reach?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Standing on the plank between the lighter
and the wharf.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ugh! And they might have toppled him
into the water any minute!” cried Mrs. Skipper.
“I am sure I hope they won’t come near me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The most angry of them are gone on, as I
told you,” replied Chatham. “And that is well
for you, perhaps; for never did you see angrier
faces. They called out, two hundred voices like
one, that it was a sin they should have to pay
twenty pence for their quartern while he had a
houseful of wheat stored up, and more coming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so it is, if he can get more when that
is done.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the very thing he cannot be sure of
doing, as he told these people they must know
very well. No one can be sure beforehand when
and how he may get in corn from abroad; and,
at any rate, it cannot be had till it has grown
monstrously dear at home; and so he insisted
upon it that he was doing the wisest thing in
selling his corn as others sell it, and no cheaper;
that we may not eat it all up now, and starve
entirely before the end of the winter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I grumble as much as anybody else
at our having to pay twenty pence for our loaf;
begging your pardon, Mrs. Skipper, whose fault
I know it is not. I, with a wife and children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.33'>33</span>can’t reconcile myself to such a price. I grumble
as much as anybody.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So do I,” said Chatham.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only you don’t blame Kirkland.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kirkland can’t help the grievance, any more
than you or I; and I am sure he suffers enough
by it. There is a loss of some hundred pounds
by this one cargo. It is more than half spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Spoiled! How?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sea-water has got to it, and it is downright
rotten.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a pity, when it is so particularly
wanted! Such accidents signify twice as much
at some times as at others; and that this should
happen now—just when bread is at the highest!
O dear! what a pity!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would not signify half so much if there
was more certainly coming, and the people knew
what they had to depend on. But if more is ordered,
it may come or it may not; and it may
be in good time, or not arrive till the season is
far advanced; and so much must be paid for
shipping charges (always dear in autumn), that
it may mount up as high as our own home supply,
after all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a worry Kirkland must be in!” observed
Kay. “He is not one of the quietest at
any time; and now, between hurrying his correspondents
abroad, and finding his cargo spoiled at
home, and having the people gathering about him
with their clamour, he must feel something like
a dog with a saucepan tied to its tail.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not like your master, Mr. Kay,” observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.34'>34</span>Mrs. Skipper. “There is no law to meddle with
his selling his brass abroad or at home, as he
likes; and so he knows what to expect, and how
to live with his neighbours; and has little to
worry him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Skipper. My
master is prevented selling freely abroad and at
home; and prevented by the same law that worries
Kirkland. And the worry is great, I can tell
you; though Oliver does not run about, losing
his breath and fidgeting himself like Kirkland,
but walks so solemn and slow, you might take
him for a Quaker.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I thought, as his foundry is always at
work, and people must have things made of
brass, and nobody objecting,—I thought things
went easily enough with Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“His foundry works at night,” said Chatham,
“and his metal runs as well at Christmas as at
Midsummer; and yet Oliver’s prosperity depends
on rain and sunshine as much as if zinc and
copper were sown in the furrows and came up
brass.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, now,” said Mrs. Skipper, “that is
one of your odd speeches, Chatham. And Mr.
Kay nods as if he knew what you meant.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have good reason to know,” replied Kay.
“I and my fellow-workmen must have higher
wages when corn is scarce, and then Oliver must
put a better price upon his brass, without either
his or our gaining anything by it: and then——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O ay; there will be less brass bought; that
is what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.35'>35</span>“Moreover, there are plenty of people abroad
that want brass, and would take it if they could
give us corn in exchange,—so regularly as that
they and we might know what we are about.
And so, as sure as sunshine or rain falls short,
some of Oliver’s furnaces die out: and as sure
as Kirkland’s corn-vessels might come and
go, without let or hinderance, our foundry
would send a light, night and day, over all the
vale.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the way Chatham’s sayings come
out,” observed the widow: “but I think he
might as well speak plain at once, and make no
mysteries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I spoke plain enough about what was going
to happen to you and your bread,” said Chatham,
“and now you will soon see whether it
comes out true; for here is the street filling fast,
I see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor souls!” cried the widow, having run
out at her door to look. “They do not seem
creatures to be afraid of, when one comes
close to them;—so tired and lagging! I say,
Dixon, won’t you have something to eat after
your walk? Smith, you look worse still, and I
saw how early you were off to your work this
morning, and you have a good way to go to
supper. Try a roll, won’t you? Come, that’s
right, Bullen, set to, and tell me if it is not good
bread; and you, Taylor,—carry it home to your
wife, if you scruple to eat it yourself.—Bless you,
make no speeches! I only wish I had more;
but this is all, you see, except the dough that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.36'>36</span>laid for the morning, and that belongs to my
customers, not to me.—Well; I am pleased you
like it. I would have thought to get in some
cheese, if I had known, before the shop was
shut, that you would be passing.—Never make
such a favour of it. I’ll ask the same of you
some day. Or you will remember me when
times mend with you.—Do look, Mr. Kay; if
they be not going to cheer!—I never thought
to live to be cheered.—Bless them! how hearty
they are!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And laughing, sparkling, and waving her right
arm vehemently, the dame watched in their progress
down the street the neighbours whose approach
she had thought, an hour before, she
could scarcely survive. Kay followed the munching
groups, to see what they would do next;
and Chatham drew Mary’s arm within his own,
to escort her home, leaving the widow to bolt
herself in, and survey at her leisure her bare
shelves, and sweep down her empty shop-board,—soliloquizing,
as she went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“I forgot these little sweet-cakes, or some of
the children should have had them,—for they are
rather stale. It is well they did not press for the
dough, for I don’t believe I could have refused
them anything at the moment,—and then what
should I have said to the Fergussons’ man in the
morning?—Well; it does look forlorn, now it is
all over; and it was but this morning that I refused
to take Mrs. Holmes’s ten-shilling bonnet because
I thought I could not afford it; and now I have
given away,—let me see how many shillings’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.37'>37</span>worth of bread! Ugh! I dare not think of it.
But it is done, and can’t be undone; and besides
I dare say they would have taken it, if I had not
given it; and, as I bargained with them, they
will do the same for me some day. Smith does
look rarely bad, to be sure. I wish he be not
going; though, if he be, it will be pleasant to
think that one gave him a meal when he was
hungry. Not that it won’t be pleasant to remember
the same thing if he lives. I wonder
what his poor wife’s expectation is concerning
him. If she loses him, I hope she will find it no
more of a trouble than I have done. So much
less than I thought! I think poor Mrs. Kay
droops almost as much as Smith. But there’s
no knowing. Those weakly people often live
the longest;—except, to be sure, when they have
got into a habit like hers. Not a word has her
husband ever let drop about it. I wonder
whether he knows as much as I do. He shall
never hear a word of it from me, nor not even
Mary, though I fancy she can’t be blind.
Catch Mary Kay blind to anything! For all
she looks so dull and stony when she chooses,
she sees as sharp as a hawk,—and has such a way
of setting one down. She’s a good creature too,
with all she does for those children; and nothing
could be more handy than she was about the
bread to-night. I wish she might chance to look
in in the morning, and give me more of her
handiness, to help to make the place look a little
less forlorn than it does with all these empty
shelves. I was very hasty, to be sure, in emptying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.38'>38</span>them; but, as the parson said on Sunday,
God loves a cheerful giver. So now, I will cast
a look to see if the dough is rising, and go to
bed; for it must be full late, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Chatham and Mary were meanwhile walking
home, conversing after their fashion,—making
six words do where others would use twenty.
An incident occurred on which they understood
each other without any words at all. A gleam
of light fell across the street as a door on the
shadowy side of the way slowly opened, to let
out a woman, who walked along under the houses,
slowly and with her head hung down. It was
the door of the gin-shop that opened, and it would
have been absurd to pretend not to know the
woman. Mary instantly slackened her pace, and
motioned to cross over to the dark side.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is steady enough,” said Chatham. “She
will get on very well by herself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure she will. It is not quite come to
that yet. But let her get home first, and not
know that we have been following her. It is
only merciful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She shall have mercy from me;—more perhaps
than from those who are answerable for her
failing and sinking as she does, poor soul!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary consented to turn back to the end of the
street, to give a little more time, and asked
whether grindstone cutting was not warm work
in these sultry noons. She had learned all she
wanted about grindstones by the time she could
safely knock at her brother’s door with the hope
that there was somebody stirring within to open it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.39'>39</span>“I say nothing about coming in to sit with
you all till Kay comes, because——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was not going to ask you to-night. To-morrow
evening, perhaps. Good night now. I
hear her coming. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And Chatham was out of sight from within,
before Mrs. Kay, her bonnet off, and her cap
somehow not put on, opened the door, and left
Mary to fasten it.</p>

<h3 id='ch1.3' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <br> FASTERS AND FEASTERS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>There were two opposite lights on the horizon
that night, to those who looked out from the
village. While the moon sank serenely behind
the dark western hills, a red flame shot
up, amidst volumes of wreathing smoke, in the
direction of Sheffield. Some persons were trying
the often-repeated experiment of gaining
bread by the destruction of that by which bread
is gained. A metal-mill was gutted, its machinery
broken, and its woodwork burned, because
the sea water had got to Kirkland’s corn; and
more mills were threatened in case the price of
bread did not fall within a few days. As no one
could answer for the price of bread falling within
the time specified, the only thing to be done was
to take measures to avert the promised destruction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.40'>40</span>For this purpose, strict inquiries were
made as to what the inhabitants of the district
had been about the preceding evening; who
had gone home from the harvest-field; who attended
the arrival of Kirkland’s corn; and how
many there were who could give no good account
of themselves. Early in the morning the officers
of justice were abroad, and Mr. Fergusson and
his sons were seen riding about, greeted not the
less respectfully wherever they went from its
being known that their object was to bring some
of their neighbours to justice. Mr. Fergusson’s
character stood too high among his tenants to
allow of their thinking the worse of him under
any misfortunes that might happen. Let him do
what he might in his character of magistrate, he
was trusted to do what was right, as he showed
himself, on all occasions, not only compassionate
to the sufferings of the people, but as wise in
discerning the causes of the suffering as anxious
to relieve it when relief was in his power. Accordingly,
hats were touched when he looked in
the faces of those whom he met this morning,
and ready answers given to his inquiries where
the innocent were called upon to speak, and respectful
ones from the guilty, when the necessity
came upon them of making out a case. All the
complaisance that there was, however, was engrossed
by the Mr. Fergussons. The constables
got only sneers and short answers, and men and
women looked suspiciously on one another all
through the district, none knowing what a neighbour
might have the power to tell. Perhaps so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.41'>41</span>many cross words were never spoken in one day
in the vale, as the day after the burning of Halsted’s
mill. “What do you look at me for? You
had better look to yourself,” was the common
sentiment at the forge, in the field, and on the
alehouse bench. As for the children, they were
so perplexed with instructions what they were to
say, that it was only to be hoped no one would
ask them any questions.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not to be supposed that Mrs. Skipper
could stay quietly at home while strangers were
passing up and down the street about whom her
journeyman could give her no information, and
while reports were travelling round of one neighbour
and another being compromised. She
burst in at Kay’s, just after he was gone to his
work, when his wife was preparing to put away
breakfast, and Mary was beating out the corn
which she had gleaned the evening before, and
which was destined to the mill this day.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not brought you a hot roll this morning,
Mrs. Kay; no, nor so much as a crust. I
cannot afford any more of that at present; and
so you will not look for it from me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you speak in that way to me for?
I don’t know what you mean,” said Mrs. Kay,
with an angry, puzzled stare.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor I what you would be at, I’m sure,” replied
Mrs. Skipper. “One would not believe
you were the soft-spoken Mrs. Kay, now-a-days.
You can be sharper in your speech than ever I
am, let me tell you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the more reason why you should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.42'>42</span>soft in yours,” said Mary. “She has borne
with you sometimes, when you have been better
in health than she is now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; that is true: and she does look so
poorly.... Ah! now, there’s master John
coming out with a speech about my fresh colour
again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John was not thinking about anybody’s colour.
He wanted to know whether it was not true that
he had had eleven-pence change from her the
night before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure you had, after taking a penny
roll.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John called his mother to witness, that she
might tell his father, that he was in possession of
a shilling before the troubles began at Kirkland’s;
to say nothing of those farther on. His
father had doubted his getting that shilling
honestly, and had desired his mother to take
possession of the eleven pence till the whole was
unquestionably accounted for; and now John
wanted his money back again. Mrs. Kay did
not, however, heed his request; and the matter
ended in Mary’s persuading the boy that if he
had the money by the time he was at liberty to
go out, it would do very well, instead of pressing
for it now that his mother was busy thinking of
something else.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, take care, Mrs. Kay!” cried her
neighbour. “Your hand shakes so, you will certainly
let the dish down, and that will cost you more
than a meal of my best bread would have done.
Well! that is a beautiful potato to have left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.43'>43</span>among the peelings. And here’s another! I
wonder you let the children scatter their food
about in that manner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis not the children,” observed Mary.
“They have not more than they are very willing
to eat, poor things! Their mother has but little
appetite, and she is apt to slip her food back into
the dish, that it may not make her husband uneasy.—I
want your help more than she does,”
she continued, seeing that Mrs. Skipper’s officious
assistance was obstinately refused by the poor
woman. “Will you step behind, and help me to
beat and winnow my corn, if you have a minute
to spare?”</p>

<p class='c001'>With all her heart, Mrs. Skipper said; but she
<em>had</em> an errand, though it was not to bring cider
or hot bread. She had learned the secret of
making potato-bread: not the doughy, distasteful
stuff that many people were eating, but light,
digestible, palatable bread. She would not tell
the secret to everybody,—giving away her own
trade; but when she saw a family of old friends
eating potatoes, morning, noon, and night, she
could not help telling them how they might get
something better.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary thanked her, and observed that she did
not know how she could put her gleaned corn to
a better use than in making the experiment of a
batch of mixed flour and potato-bread.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! do; and I will treat you to the baking,
and look well to it myself. For my credit’s sake,
you know; having set you to try. Come, let
us have the corn beat out.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.44'>44</span>They went to the back of the house to thresh
and winnow, and then the widow’s first exclamation
was about how sadly out of sorts Mrs. Kay
seemed to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>“These are not times for her,” replied Mary.
“They bear harder upon such as she was than
upon anybody. Who could have thought, you
know, when she was an only child, brought up
delicately for a poor man’s daughter, that she
would come to loathe a potato breakfast, and
have no other?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bless you! I know,” whispered the widow,
with a wise look. “People may take things
over-night that leave them no sense, nor temper,
nor appetite in the morning. My dear, I see
how it is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary was apparently too busy with the wheat
to take any notice of this intimation. The next
thing she said was,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where are all the potatoes to come from
that will be wanted if people take to this new
sort of bread? and indeed whether they do or
not; for potatoes they must eat, either by themselves
or made into bread. How are we to get
enough?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The price is rising, they say; faster than the
price of anything else, except corn: and if you
go up yonder towards the moors, you will see
what a quantity of new ground is being taken up
for growing potatoes. I have had half a mind
to try what I could do with a bit of a field myself.
Anderson knows what he is about, generally;
and what he tries in a large way might be safe
for such as we in a small.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.45'>45</span>“I would not try,” replied Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, not if you were me, because you think
I fly from one thing to another, and do myself
harm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides,” said Mary, attempting no denial,
“how will it be with you next year, if there
should chance to be a fine wheat and barley
crop? People do not live on potatoes when they
can get bread; and I am sure it is not to be
wished that they should. I hope there will be
much less demand for potatoes next year; and
it is likely there will. We have had so many
bad seasons, it cannot be long before a good one
comes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then what a pity it will be that so much
money has been spent in fencing and managing
these potato-grounds! It may chance to
come to be worth while to turn the sheep on
again. That <em>would</em> be a pity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Say rather it is a pity they were ever turned
off. The land on the moors is much more fit for
them than for us to feed off; and leaving them
there would leave the money that is spent on the
land (more than it is worth, if matters went on
in their usual course) to be used in a more profitable
way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why; take your own case. If you pay so
much for hedging and ditching, and draining,
and manuring the potato-ground you have a
mind for, and the crop brings you no more next
year than the same plot now brings as a sheep-feed,
is not the money just lost that was laid out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.46'>46</span>in making a field of it? My opinion is that it
would bring less; and if it does not, it ought to
do. Our people will be badly off indeed if
food is so high next year as to make them take
your potatoes at a price that would make your
bargain a good one; and if they are obliged to
do so, they will be eating up in those potatoes
the money that should have set some of them to
work at weaving or cutlery-employment. Better
buy corn of Kirkland when we can, and let the
sheep graze on.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, when we can. There is the very thing.
If we could always do that, as much as we
pleased, we should not spend much of our
money on the moors; but it is because it is all a
chance whether we shall be buying of Kirkland
next year, that one thinks of taking the chance
of potatoes selling well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, not you. You would spend your money,
if you had any, in a little bargain of grindstones,
for the sake of a certain person.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That would depend on the price of potatoes,”
replied Mary, smiling, “for they would depend
on the price of corn; and on the price of corn
mainly depends the cutlery trade; and where is
the use of grindstones unless the cutlery business
flourishes?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is another thing to be looked to; and
that is, that those you help in cutting grindstones
do not get themselves into trouble;—ay, by
being abroad at night, and having the constables
after them in the day. I would have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.47'>47</span>consider that, my dear. Mercy! how frightened
you look,—as white as my apron! Now, don’t
push me away because I let out a thing that
made you frightened.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Angry—very angry,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not with me, to be sure; for I did not make
it, be it true or not true; though I need not have
cast it in your teeth as I did. It was Dick Rose
told me; and he said he knew it from——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do get me a little vinegar, Mrs. Skipper.
I never pinched my finger so smartly before. I
shall not be able to get my thimble on this
week.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, now, it was that made you turn white,
while you pretended to be so angry with me that
you made my heart beat in my throat. I shall
know you now another time, mistress Mary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not you,” thought Mary, as her giddy
companion bustled into the house for vinegar.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t see your sister,” said she, returning,
“but I guessed where to look for the vinegar.
Is the pain going? Well, only do you ask Dick
Rose about how the folks were seen creeping out
of the quarry, one by one,—those that worked
there, and some strangers that came to visit
them; and how——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall not ask Dick Rose any such thing,
when there is a person that can tell me so much
better,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, if he will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“John, fetch me the large blue apron,” cried
Mary; “and bring out Nanny with you. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.48'>48</span>promised she should lend a hand, and see the chaff
fly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Before John could reach the door, a sharp
scream,—the scream of a child,—was heard from
within. Mary flew to see what had happened,
but just as she was entering, her brother, seeing
that some one was behind her, slammed the door
in her face, and was heard to bolt it. Mrs. Skipper
would not listen to what she had to say about
the child having a fall, but exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I should not have thought Mr. Kay
could have behaved in that manner to you; and
he looked at me quite fierce, so as I thought had
not been in his nature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she stepped to the window to tap, and ask
an explanation: but she caught a glimpse of
something that quieted her, and sent her to stoop
down over the wheat again, without looking at
Mary, or speaking another word. Kay was
carrying his wife up stairs. The helpless arm,
hanging over his shoulder, was just visible, and
the awe-struck children, suspending their crying,
moved Mrs. Skipper to concern too deep to be
expressed in her usual giddy speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Which way are you going?” asked Mary at
length. “I am off for the mill, as soon as I can
get in to take the children with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I home; and you may depend on me,
you know for what. My tongue does run too
fast sometimes, I know; but you may depend on
me, as it was only by a chance that I was here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you!” replied Mary, warmly. “And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.49'>49</span>I will take it kindly of you to show me the way
about the bread, as soon as my corn is ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>By the united resources of the children within,
the door was unbolted, and the party allowed
egress into the street, when Mrs. Skipper turned
down, and Mary up; the children asking her,
one to go out of the way for the sake of the pond
on the heath, and another hoping to jump down
five steps of the mill-ladder, four having been
achieved last time. Mary would have been
glad to forget their mother as easily as they.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Warden saw her toiling up the slope on
the top of which the mill stood, her bundle on her
head, and a child tugging at each side of her
gown, he civilly came down to relieve her, and
told her that she was more welcome than on the
occasion of her last visit. It was a fine breezy
day, he observed, and perhaps she might like to
look about her from the top of the mill, if she
did not mind the shaking that there always was
in a wind. Mary thanked him, but dared not
leave the children, lest they should put themselves
in the way of the sails. This difficulty was soon
obviated by the miller’s taking the girl upon his
shoulder, and calling to his man to bring up the
boy, and let him play among the sacks in the
first story, or climb higher, as he liked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose you saw the fire finely from here,
if you chanced to be looking out last night,” Mary
observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My man did, as he stayed to take advantage
of the wind. He says it lighted up every turn of
the river between this and Sheffield. You may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.50'>50</span>see the smoke still, among the other smoke.
Half the country has flocked there this morning,
my father-in-law told me just now, as he passed
on his way to pay his rent. It is a good time to
choose to pay his rent, when every body is
thinking of something else than emptying his
pockets. Otherwise, it is not the safest and
pleasantest thing in the world to be carrying
money over the by-road between this and
Fergusson’s. Yonder he goes,” continued the
miller, stooping to the little girl whom he was
keeping steady with his arm round her waist.
“Yonder goes Mr. Anderson, on his black
mare. You may see him trotting along the lane
between those young oaks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will come back slower in the evening,
when he has left his money behind him,” observed
Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will not wait till evening. He will just
finish with the steward, and come home again, for
the Mr. Fergussons are abroad over the country
to-day; and besides, my father-in-law is wanted at
home every hour of the day while the improvements
are going on. Look how busy he is
thereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see; they drive the poor sheep higher and
higher up the moors, with their walls and their
ditches.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, year by year. Before these many bad
seasons, the sheep used to browse on this very
slope where my mill stands. I used to come up
among the bleaters every morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You speak as if the bad seasons were the
cause of the change.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.51'>51</span>“And so they are, mainly. Where numbers
increase as they have done here in my time, more
food will be wanted at all events, be the seasons
what they may. But when the soil yields scantily,
for years together, the inclosing will go on
faster, from the cry for food. Yonder field, red
even now with poppies, would never have been
sown if the nine-acres in the bottom had yielded
as they ought. The nine-acres used to yield as
much as was reaped this year in itself and the
poppy-field together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And there has been all the cost of taking it
in besides.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and my father-in-law does wisely to
pay that cost (if he must pay it) before his rent
is raised. He and the steward will have an argument
about that rent to-day, I fancy. The lease
will be up soon now, and rents are rising every
where; and I suppose my father-in-law is content
to let his mount up too. He would not
otherwise be carrying on all these works.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder at his being content to pay more
rent after so many short harvests.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is easier than after larger; for corn sells
dear, more than in proportion to its scarcity.
Nobody can tell you better than Anderson that
a single short harvest makes a heavy pocket;
much more a succession of short harvests.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Till the poor get a-head of the rate-payers,
I suppose,—no longer. When Mr. Anderson
has to maintain half of us down in the village,
because we cannot buy food, he will find us lighten
his pockets as fast as bad years can fill them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.52'>52</span>“The manufacturers must help him then.
They must raise their people’s wages——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so must Anderson.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They must raise their people’s wages, and
maintain the poor in the towns, and in the working
villages.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish the manufacturers joy of their good
nature. They first pay dear for their own bread,
and then pay dear for the labour which is to buy
their workmen’s bread, and then spend what profits
are left in supporting those whose labour
they cannot employ; and all to make Anderson’s
and other farmers’ pockets heavy for a little while
after bad seasons. I wish them joy of their
patience.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Anderson will want patience too, when his
turn comes. Depend upon it, as soon as he gets
fairly saddled with a high rent and high rates,
there will come a fine crop or two to make prices
as low in proportion as they now are high. He
cannot bring down his men’s wages all in a day;
much less can the rates be disburthened at once;
and so it will be well if he makes ready beforehand
for such a change.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope he does make ready; but what I see
there looks little like it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, you mean the bay-window and balcony
now making to my house, and the shrubbery
he is laying out. All that was no wish of
mine, for I thought the white house looked very
neat as it was before; and the bit of garden behind
was as much as my wife and I had time to
attend to. But her father liked that his daughter’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.53'>53</span>house should be improving while he was
adding so much to his own, and he made us accept
of the alteration, whether we would or no.
He said, that while he was sending my wife’s
sister to Paris, and bringing up her brothers to
look higher than he once thought of for them,
he could not leave her neglected, as if he was
ashamed of her having married more humbly than
the other girls will do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And his own house looks hardly like the
same place. His having built up among all the
rambling old parts gives it one face as a whole.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; three more bad years, and it will look
like a gentleman’s mansion. Yes, yes; these are
the joyous rent-days, when the steward gets every
farthing, and pretends to shake his head because
it is no more; and when the farmers try to look
dismal about the short crops, and then sing merry
songs over their ale,—such of them as have not
taken to port. Well, the millers’ day will come
in time, it is to be hoped.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When will that be?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the people are not setting their wits
to work to make potato-bread, and eating every
thing that grows rather than flour. We have
had more going and coming, more watching and
jealousy about waste, and more grumbling because
we cannot grind for nothing,—more trouble
of all sorts about a few trumpery bundles of
gleanings this last week, than about fifty sacks
when I first became a miller.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will give you as little trouble as I can with
mine,” said Mary; “but you must not call it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.54'>54</span>trumpery bundle, for it is worth much to me. If
you knew how much, I might trust you not to
waste any of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You would not dream of my wasting, if you
saw how carefully I look to every grain. Why,
I drive away the very birds themselves, if they
light when the sails stop at any time. We do
not leave the sweepings to them and the wind, as
we used to do, but sift them as a housemaid sifts
for pins. That is the reason why I do not offer
your young master a handfull for the pigeons,
as I used to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t think of it, pray. He is going to play
with the ducks on the pond as we go home, and
that will do as well: besides, I hear him laughing
now, merry enough without the pigeons.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Playing hide and seek with Jerry among
the sacks, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where he must have done playing for to-day,”
observed Mary. “How quiet every place
looks for a working day!” she continued, giving
one more glance round the horizon before she
descended. “Except the sheep, creeping like
mites on the uplands, and the labourers gathering
like ants about the new inclosures, I see nobody
stirring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I seldom see it so quiet, except on a starlight
night, when there is no noise but the whizzing
of the sails when they go by starts; or perhaps
an owl from my gable. But you see the
people in the quarries stick to their work, as if
they had no share in what was doing last night.”
And the miller looked full at Mary as he spoke.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.55'>55</span>“I see a man or two with his pick in yonder
stone-pit, hewing away as if nothing had happened.
Cannot you see them? Well, it is a
wonder your head has stood the shaking in this
breeze for so long. Many people can fix their
sight on nothing after the first two minutes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary was determined to see more of the quarries
before she went home than could be discerned
from the mill-top. She let one child peep
into the hopper to see how the corn ran down to
be ground, and the other to exhibit his jump of
five steps, with a topple at the end of it, and
then walked quickly away towards the part of
the heath where bilberries were to be found, and
where she thought she might leave her charge
safely employed while she looked into the quarry
to see whether Chatham was really there, and
whether or not he had had any transactions with
the constables since she saw him last.</p>

<h3 id='ch1.4' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br> <br> A POOR MAN’S INDUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c017'>It took but a little time to show the children how
to find bilberries, and not very much longer to
teach them not to eat what they found; after
which Mary was at liberty to walk round to the
mouth of the stone-quarry, beside which the fashioning
of grindstones went on, in subservience
to the cutlery business of Sheffield. She avoided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.56'>56</span>the sheds where the sawing and smoothing proceeded,
and looked only among the men who
were excavating the stone. But few were at
work this day; Chatham was one of them. He
was engaged high up, with his face to the rock,
and having no glances to spare for the scene
below him, or for the narrow, rough path by
which his present position must be attained.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary had never been here before, and she
lingered in hopes that Chatham might turn, and
encourage her to go on. She gathered rag-wort
from the moist recesses by the way, and paused to
observe how the ivy was spreading over a portion
of the stone face of the quarry which had been
left untouched for some time, and to listen to the
water trickling down among the weeds by a channel
which it had worn for itself. As Chatham still
did not turn, she proceeded to climb the path,
being aware that children who were playing in
the bottom had given notice of her presence, and
that face after face peeped out from beneath the
sheds to gaze, and then disappeared again. When
at length she laid her hand on the arm of the
toiling man, he started as if his tool had broken
under his blow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mary! what brought you here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I heard that the constables were after you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So did I; and here I am, if they choose to
come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what next?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My words and deeds will be taken up against
me, perhaps. Perhaps it may be found that I
am a good friend to all the parties that were quarrelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.57'>57</span>last night. This last is what I wish to
be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And trying to be so, you will get blamed by
all in turn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By all at once, if they so please. As often
as they choose to ask my opinion, as they did last
night, they shall have it, though they themselves
try to hoot me down. I do not want to meddle;
but, being bid to speak out, I will speak, out of
the fire or the water, if they bid me burn or drown.
So it is not the notion of a constable that can
frighten me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Out of fire or water, would you? Then much
more would you speak in a moonlight field. O,
tell me if you were there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How did you spend your thoughts, Mary,
those nights that you sat by the spring, during
the drought? What were you thinking about
when your sister threw down the pitcher that you
caught? That must have been a weary night to
you both.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You saw us! Then it is true; and you are
one that hopes to get food by night-arming?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I. If the question of stinting food or
getting plenty of it were waiting to be decided
by arms,—the hungry on one side and the full on
the other,—I would take up my pike with a hopeful
heart, however sorry I might be that blood
should be shed in settling so plain a matter. But
what could a little band of pale complainers do,
creeping under the shadows of yonder walls, with
limbs as trembling as their hearts are firm? How
should they be champions of the right while they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.58'>58</span>are victims of the wrong? They must be fed
before they can effectually struggle for perpetual
food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor wretches! they did look, it seemed to
me, as if they had no life nor spirit in them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The spirit goes from the sunk eye to swell
the heart, Mary; and those that have not strength
of arm this day, may prove, many a day hence,
what their strength of purpose has been. This
is what the authorities ought to look to. Instead
of scouring the country to wake up a wretch from
the noon-day sleep which he seeks because he
has had no morning meal, they should provide
against the time when his arm will be strong to
make his hungry dreams come true. Instead of
carrying one man in disgrace from his loom, and
another from the forge, and another from the
quarry, to tell the old story—‘We have been
patient long, and can endure no longer,’ our
rulers should be satisfying themselves whether
this is one of the stories which is to have no
end. It cannot be very pleasing to their ears.
The wonder is, that if they are weary of it, they
go on from century to century to cry, ‘Tell us
this story again.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They cannot yet be so weary of it as we.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; for they hear others in turn with it,—tales
of victories abroad, and of rejoicings at
home in places where no poor man sets his foot.
Their painters show them pictures of jolly rent-days,
and the music they hear is triumphant and
spirit-stirring. If they go abroad in the day,
they laugh to see their enemies made mirth of in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.59'>59</span>the streets; and if at night, they glorify themselves
and one another in the light of illuminations.
Thus they can forget our story for a
while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would rather they should come here than
go myself among them, to be the merriest of
the merry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay; if we could set each of them down in
this vale as one of ourselves, they would be surprised
to find how dismal night-lights are when
they shine upon scowling brows and hollow
cheeks; and how little spirit war-music has when
it cannot drown the moans of the famished, and
the cries of mothers weeping for their children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me that their very religion helps
to deceive them about us. Last Sunday, the
clergyman looked comfortably about him, and
spoke very steadily when he read about the
springing corn in the furrows, and that the little
hills rejoice on every side. I thought of the red
poppies and the stones in Fergusson’s new fields,
and the scanty gleanings on the uplands, and
my heart turned back from my Bible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It should not have done that, Mary. It is
not that the Bible is in fault, but that some people
read it wrong. There is never any day of
any year when there are not springing grains and
ripening harvests on God’s earth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You ought to be able to speak to that, having
gone so far round the world when you were a
boy at sea.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can speak to it. If there are angels hovering
over the fields, as ’tis said there once were,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.60'>60</span>and if the earth lies stretched beneath them as in a
map, they may point to one fruitful place or another,
and never cease their song, ‘Thou visitest
the earth and waterest it. The pastures are clothed
with flocks, and the valleys are covered over
with corn. Thou crownest the year with thy
goodness.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But of what use is it to us that there is corn
somewhere, if we have it not? Are we to bless
God that he feeds some people somewhere, while
there are still poppies and stones where we look
for bread?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You might as well ask ‘of what use is the
fruit on the tree to him who sits hungering at its
foot?’ And, ‘is not a parched traveller to repine
at his thirst, when a well is springing in the
neighbouring shade?’ What would you say to
hungering and thirsty men like these?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Bless God that there is fruit, and climb to
reach it. Be thankful that there is water, and go
down to take your fill.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are required by our rulers to do one
half of this reasonable thanksgiving, and to forego
the remainder. We are bidden to thank God
for his gifts, but forbidden to reach and take.—How
great is the folly of this, you would see at
a glance, if you could go where I have been.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To see how perfectly happy people are in
the fruitful places, while so many are suffering
here? To see how unequal is the lot of dwellers
in different countries?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so; but worse. There is but too much
equality in the lot of dwellers in fruitful and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.61'>61</span>barren soils; between those who are too many
for their food, and those who bury their spare
corn out of their way. If some were satisfied
while others suffer, the sufferers might be the
more patient because all were not afflicted like
themselves; but it is when all suffer, and might
yield mutual relief, if they were not prevented,
that patience is impossible. I would ask no man
to have patience with our state who had seen the
state of many others, striving after patience as
painfully as we.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What others?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, there is the labouring man of Poland,
for one. He creeps out of his log hut, shivering,
half naked, in the first cold of autumn, to feed
his pigs with the grain——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Grain! What sort of grain?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wheat, or rye, as may happen; whichever
happens to be rotting the fastest. Between him
and the black forests on the horizon are plains,
stretching away for leagues upon leagues, some
sprinkled with a few cattle, and some showing
a stubble that you would be glad to have the
gleaning of; and others lying waste, though
richer as soil than many a field of Anderson’s.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, but that is a shame, with the people so
poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would make the people no richer to till
those wastes, unless the crops could sell. The
people there do not want food——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I think, if they feed their beasts on wheat
and rye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They want clothes, and good houses, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.62'>62</span>that makes a dwelling comfortable; and yet,
though our warehouses are overfull of broad
cloth, and we could furnish twice as much metal-work
as we do, if we had bread for the workmen,
it is only by fits and starts that we will let Poland
sell us corn, and clothe her sons. Then, again,
near the Black Sea——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that sea really blacker than other seas?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sun glitters there as bright as on the
heaving Indian bays, and it is as blue when the
sky is clear as any tarn in yonder hills. God
has done all to make it beautiful, not only from
above, but by spreading fertile tracts all along
its shores. If man would do his part, sending
ships upon its bosom, and leaving no spot desolate
around, it might be made the happy place
that, in my opinion, the whole earth might be
made, and will be, some time or other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The people are not happy there now, then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not what we should call happy, though they
may like better than we should the flitting from
plain to plain to gather corn, as bees flit from
blossom to blossom for honey. They reap for
three seasons from a field, and then move to
another, leaving an exhausted soil and a desolate
place behind them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We might teach them husbandry, if they
would let us have some of the fruits of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then they might learn to live a little
more like Christians than they do, and have some
of the pleasures that we have, in the midst of all
our hardships, in growing up from the state of
brute beasts into that of thinking men. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.63'>63</span>are other parts,—in America,—where thinking
men live who fret in the impossibility of making
their children wiser and more civilized than
themselves,—which should be every man’s aim
for his children. They can give them work,—but
what is it all for?—food. They can give
them wealth,—but what does it all consist of?—food.
They can hold out a prospect of increase,—but
of what?—food. They long for a thousand
comforts, if they could but convert their corn
into these comforts. They perceive that there
are a thousand advantages and blessings over the
sea, if they could but stretch out a long arm to
throw corn into our lap, and reach home—things
which we can now use no more than they, because
we have too little bread, and they have too
much. Though their sons are thus condemned
to be clowns, and ours to be paupers, we must
hope that they will learn from our follies so to
deal together as that the clown may become a
wise man, and the pauper take his stand on the
rights of his industry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But why, if so many countries are fruitful,
is England alone barren?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“England is fruitful in corn; but yet more so
in men, and in arts which she chooses to make
barren of food. England has corn on her hills,
corn in her valleys, corn waving over her plains;
yet this corn is not enough, or not always enough,
for the multitudes who gather together in her villages,
and throng her cities, and multiply about
her workhouses. If this corn is not enough, England’s
duty is,—not to starve hundreds, or half-starve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.64'>64</span>thousands of her children, but to bring out
corn from all the apparatus of her arts. She
should bring out corn from her looms, corn from
her forges, corn from her mines; and when more
than all this is wanted, let her multiply her looms
and her forges, and sink new mines from which
other millions may derive their bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You dig bread from this hard rock, I suppose,
when you furnish grindstones on which the
cutlery is to be prepared which may be exchanged
with the Russian and the American for
corn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do: and to limit this exchange is not only
to limit the comforts of us workmen, but to forbid
that there shall be more lives in our borders
than the fruits of our own soil can support. There
is room for myriads more of us, and for a boundless
improvement of our resources; these resources
are forbidden to improve, and these myriads to
exist. Whence rulers derive their commission
thus to limit that to which God has placed no
perceivable bound, let them declare.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then there are not too many of us, if all
were wise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By no means. If all were permitted to be
as happy as God bids them be, there would be
neither the recklessness of those who multiply
without thought, nor the forced patience of those
who have a conscience and listen to it. If all
were wise, they would proportion their numbers
to their food; but then that food would not be
stinted by arbitrary laws which issue in evil to
all. Our rulers turn away, if perchance they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.65'>65</span>see in the streets infants that pine for a while,
only to die; and pronounce that such children
should never have been born. And it may be
true; but it is not for our rulers to pronounce,
except with shame; for it is only while waiting
for their becoming just that it behoves the people
to be as self-denying as they require.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Strangers that pass this way for their pleasure,”
observed Mary, “wonder at the hardness
of our shepherds in turning their tender lambs
exposed upon the moors, where, if some thrive,
many pine. Do not they themselves (as many
of them as have to do with making laws) turn
out the young of our cities into stony fields, where
they pine like starving lambs? There is small
use in pitying—small kindness in saying that such
should never have been born, if there are indeed
fields where for stones they may gather bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I see money buried in the furrows of
such fields,” replied Chatham, “I feel that it is
taken twice from those whose due it is;—from
the mechanic who, instead of standing idle, would
fain be producing corn on his anvil; and from
the spiritless boor abroad, who would as willingly
exchange his superfluity to supply his need.
When I see the harrow pass over such fields, I
see it harrow human souls; and voices cry out
from the ground, however little the whistling
husbandman may heed them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The husbandman will not long whistle, if all
must at length scramble for food. His turn to
see his infants pine must come at last.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At last! It comes early, for there are more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.66'>66</span>to follow. There is the farmer to swear that it is
hard upon him that his labourers must live, as it
is upon his substance that they must live. Then
comes he for whom the farmer labours in his
turn. He complains that, let the sunshine be as
bright, the dews as balmy as they may, he can
reap scarcely half the harvest of his gains, and
that he is pressed upon by the crowds who come
to him for bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He can hardly wonder at this, when it is he
himself who forbids their going elsewhere. To
what third party would he commend them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps he would quote Scripture, as may
be done for all purposes, and tell them that the
clouds drop fatness, and bid them look up and
await the promised manna. Till it comes, however,
or till he and his tribe have unlocked the
paths of the seas, he has no more right to complain
of the importunity which disturbs him
than the child who debars the thrush from its
native woods has to be angry when it will not
plume itself and sing, but beats against its wires
because its fountain is no longer filled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I could not but think something like this
when I saw even so good a man as our Mr. Fergusson
on rough terms with some of the people he
met on the way, when he went out to view the
harvest-home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The harvest-home which used to be a merry
feast when it was clear that its golden fruits were
to be wealth to all! Now, there is no knowing
what is to become of it; whether it shall be
divided and consumed in peace, or scrambled for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.67'>67</span>by men possessed by the demon of want, or
burned by those who cannot share, and are therefore
resolved that none others shall enjoy. It
is said, and no one contradicts, that the harvest-moon
rose clear, and lighted up alike every mansion
and cottage in the dale; but I was abroad to
see her rise; and I declare that with my mind’s
eye I beheld her eclipsed, shedding a sickly light,
maybe, upon the manor and the farm, but blight
and darkness into the dwellings of the poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It has ever been God’s hand that has drawn
a shadow over sun and moon, but now——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now man has usurped the office, and uses
his power, not once and again to make the people
quail, but day by day. To none is the sun so
dark as to the dim-eyed hungerer. To none
is the moon so sickly as to the watcher over a
pining infant’s cradle. Let man remove the
shadow of social tyranny, let him disperse the
mists which rise from a deluge of tears, and
God’s sun and moon will be found to make the
dew-drops glitter as bright as ever on the lowliest
thatch, and to shine mildly into humble
chambers where those who are not kneeling in
thanksgiving are blessing God as well by the
soundness of their repose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are those whom you meet at midnight of
the same mind with you? Do they go to church
on Sunday to bring away this sort of religion for
the week?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They do not go to church,—partly because
they know themselves to be squalid,—partly because,
as you say, their hearts turn back from
their Bible. They are slow to believe that their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.68'>68</span>soul-sickness will be pitied somewhere, if not by
man. They no doubt feel also some of the unwillingness
of guilt; but I can tell,—I will tell those
whom it may concern,—that the way to bring these
men from their unlawful drill into the church aisle
is to preach to them full, and not hungering, that
God giveth to all living things food in its season.
This, like all other words of God, is true; but with
his vicegerents rests the blasphemy if shrunken
lips whisper that it is a lie.—Such sufferers, if they
did make Sabbath, have not the leisure that I have
to work out their religion by themselves, during
the week, making it and toil lighten each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So that is what you do in this place,—high
up on the face of the stone, with no moving thing
near you but these dancing weeds overhead, and
no sound but the dull shock of your own blows!
So your religion is what you think over all day!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In some form or other; but you know religion
takes many forms;—all forms, or religion
would be good for little. I am not always thinking
of the church and the sermon; but sometimes
of how I am to advise the people that come to
me, and sometimes of what I could tell the
powerful if I could get their ear; and oftener
than all, Mary, of what was said between you
and me the evening before, and what will be
said this evening, and of what we may dare to
look to in a future time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With so much to think about, you could do
without me,” said Mary, smiling. “You would
hardly miss me much, if I was drowned to-morrow,
till the country is quiet, and there is nothing
more to be complained of.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.69'>69</span>“Meanwhile, Mary, you want nothing more,
I suppose, than to clean trenchers and wash and
mend stockings. To do this would make you
perfectly happy for evermore, would it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is light work cleaning trenchers for a half-starved
family,” replied Mary; “and as for the
stockings, the children are going barefoot, one by
one. So, no light jesting, Chatham; but tell me—”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who these men are just at your shoulder?
They are constables, and come for me, I rather
think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what next?” inquired Mary, as she had
done half an hour before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know no more than when you asked me
last; but I suppose they will either let me come
back here to think over the matters we have been
talking about, or put me where I may consider
them at more leisure still, not having my tools
with me wherewith to hew down stone walls.
You well know, in that case, Mary, what I shall
be thinking about and doing; and so you will
not trouble yourself or be frightened about me.
Promise me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly: what should I be frightened
about?” asked Mary, with white lips. “You
cannot have done wrong,—you cannot have
joined in——”</p>

<p class='c001'>She stopped short, as the constable was within
hearing.  His office was an easy one, as Chatham
cheerfully surrendered himself; and Mary
turned to descend, as soon as he had flung on
his coat and disposed of his tools. They were
permitted to walk arm-in-arm, and to talk, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.70'>70</span>they chose to do it so as to be overheard. Not
being at liberty in heart and mind for such conversation
as the constable might share, they
passed in silence the groups of workpeople, some
of whom grinned with nervousness or mirth, and
others gazed with countenances of grave concern;
while a very few showed their sympathy
by carefully taking no notice of what must be
considered the disgrace of their companion. In
a little while, Mary was told she must go no
farther; and, presently after, she was at the door
of her own home, with a child in each hand,—one
talking of bilberries, and the other telling a
story of a duckling in the pool, which had billed
a worm larger than it knew what to do with;
and how it ended with dropping the worm in
deep water, and, after a vain poke in pursuit of
it, had scuttled after the rest of the brood. All
this Mary was, or seemed to be, listening to,
when her brother looked out from the door, and
told her impatiently that he had been watching
for her this half-hour. His wife was asleep at
present; but he had not liked to leave her alone
in the house, much as he wished to go out and
see what sort of a net the constables were drawing
in.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you heard of anybody that they have
taken?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well! Anybody that we know?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; Chatham.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kay looked at her for a moment, sent the
children different ways, and then looked at her
again.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.71'>71</span>“You are not down-hearted, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will come out clear, depend upon it: my
life upon it, it will turn out well. Oh! it will
turn out a good thing,—a real good thing!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Everything does.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, ay, in the end; but I mean——But
come, sit you down. I am in no hurry to go
out; and I will get you something after your
long walk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pray do not; I do not wish it, indeed. I
will help myself when I am hungry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As she seemed not to want him, Kay thought
perhaps he had better go. Before he closed the
door behind him, he saw that Mary was taking
a long, deep draught of cold water.</p>

<h3 id='ch1.5' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span><br> <br> TAKING COUNSEL.</h3>

<p class='c017'>As there was sufficient evidence, in the magistrate’s
opinion, of Chatham’s having been once
present at the midnight drill, and active among
the crowd by the river-side the night before, he
was committed to prison, it being left to himself
to prove, at the time of trial, for what purposes
he had mixed himself up with the rioters. As
he was a very important personage in his village,
his jeopardy excited much speculation and interest.
For the first two or three days, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.72'>72</span>much curiosity among the neighbours to see
Mary, in order to observe how she took it. Mary
was somehow always busy with her sister and
the children; but when a gossip or two had become
qualified to testify to her aspect—that she
looked just as usual,—and when the children
were found to have nothing particular to tell
about her, everybody was vexed at having been
troubled on behalf of a person who was never
put out, happen what might.</p>

<p class='c001'>Times were so flat this autumn that there was
abundance of leisure for talking about whatever
might turn up, and no lack of tongues to treat
thereof. Some of the foundry-men were turned
off, as it had been necessary to raise the wages
of those who remained. As there was no increase
of business at the time this rise of wages
took place, and as Oliver himself was living at
a larger expense as provisions became dearer,
there was no alternative for him but to turn off
some of his men, contract his business, and be
as content as he could with smaller profits than he
had ever before made. By the rise of wages, his
remaining men were, for a short time, relieved
from the extreme of misery they had endured in
the interval between the great increase in the cost
of provisions and the raising of their wages; but
they were no richer than they had formerly
been with two-thirds of the nominal amount of
the present recompense of their labour. Want
still pressed, and must still press, up to the point
of Oliver having no more wages to give, unless
the deficiencies of the harvest might be supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.73'>73</span>by large importations from abroad. In the uncertainty
whether this would be done, and with
the certainty before their eyes that there had not
been food enough in the country for three years
past, Anderson and the neighbouring farmers
took in more and more land, and flung about the
abundance of money they received for their dear
corn.</p>

<p class='c001'>This money was not the less buried in the inferior
new land for its being passed from hand
to hand among the labourers. The guinea that
came out of Anderson’s profits of the preceding
year, to be paid to Kay as wages, was spent in
buying a third less bread of Mrs. Skipper than
might have been had in better years. The baker,
in her turn, bought less flour of Warden with it
than in former times; and Warden used it for a
dear bargain with Kirkland, and Kirkland with
Anderson for wheat. Anderson paid it to the
ploughman of his new fields, for less labour than
the same sum had procured for better land, and
with the prospect of a less return to the labour
employed. The guinea would then go again into
Mrs. Skipper’s till for still less bread than before;
while Anderson was making answer to all complaints
about this waste, that he should not long
be the better for it, as the taking in of every new
field would oblige him to pay his landlord more
of the produce of every superior field at the expiration
of his lease.</p>

<p class='c001'>The circulation of this morsel of wealth,
dwindling on every transfer, was easily traceable
in a small society like that of the village. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.74'>74</span>waste could be detected in every direction, and
the landlord stood marked as the focus of it.
Whether Mr. Fergusson was the better for the
waste incurred on his account was a separate
question; and, till it was decided, he stood in a
remarkable relation to the people about him: he
was their injurer and their benefactor;—their
injurer, in as far as he was one of the persons
for whose sake a bad system was upheld;—their
benefactor, in his capacity of a wealthy and benevolent
resident among them. He was taunted
with being the landowner, and was offered obeisance
as Mr. Fergusson. All were complaining
that he received an unconscionable share of the
fruits of their labour; but there was not one who
would not have grieved at any misfortune that
might befall him. They talked loudly against
him and his class for narrowing the field of their
exertions, and praised the pains and good-nature
with which he devised employment for those who
were perpetually being turned out of work.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that he must have supported these
extra labourers as paupers, if he had not rather
chosen to get some work out of them in return
for the cost of their subsistence, made no difference
in the kindness with which Mr. Fergusson
attended to their interests, and endeavoured to
preserve in them a spirit of independence till
better times. The effort was vain under a system
which authorized men to say that they had not
surrendered their independence, but that it had
been taken from them, and that those who took
it away might make the best they could of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.75'>75</span>absence. Notwithstanding all that Fergusson
could do, paupers increased in the parish; and
while a few stout men, who were turned off from
the various works in the neighbourhood, were
taken on by Anderson, to try their hands at a
new kind of labour, many more lay about asleep
on the moors, or gathered in knots to gossip, in
the intervals of being worse employed.</p>

<p class='c001'>No place could be obtained for Kay’s boy,
John, who pleased himself with looking about
him while he had no business to do, and amusing
himself as he best could. The less objection
was made to this at home, as it was hoped that
his curiosity might now and then make him forget
the time, and justify his going without a
meal—a consideration which was becoming of
more and more importance in Kay’s family. It
happened that Bill Hookey, the shepherd-lad,
was one day leaning against the door of a cutler’s
workshop, when his old companion, John, ran
up, pushing back his hair from his hot forehead.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d be glad to be as cool as you,” said John,
“standing gaping here. I have been at the
forge: crept in when they did not see me, and
got behind the bellows. I gave them such a puff
when they were not expecting it,—I nearly got
flogged. They let me off for blowing for them
till there was no more breath in my body than in
the empty bellows. But I don’t half like standing
here: come to the other side; you will see
just as well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bill stuck out his legs colossus-fashion, and
yawned again.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.76'>76</span>“’Twas just where you are standing that
Brett was when the grindstone flew; and those
grindstones make ugly splinters, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I a’n’t afraid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, because you’ve been in the moors all
your days, and have not seen mishaps with
grindstones and such. You should have seen
Duncan. The knife he was grinding flew up,
and it was a done thing before he knew what he
was about. The cut was only across the wrist;
but the whole arm was perished, and good for
nothing, just in that minute. The Duncans are
all off to Scotland, with nothing to look to, after
having had fine wages all this time—for he was
a capital workman; but, as Anderson says, we
have too many folks out of work here already to
be expected to keep a Scotchman. What accidents
do happen to people, to be sure!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, they do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I wonder you put yourself in the way
of one, when you would be quite safe by just
crossing over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh! grindstones very often don’t fly, nor
knives either.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But they very often do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He a’n’t afraid,” observed Bill, nodding towards
the cutler.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, because he is paid high for the risk.
Well, I wonder any wages will tempt a man to
have such a cough as that. I suppose, however,
he don’t believe where it will end, as we do. I
often think, if several were to take turns, and
change their work about, there would be a better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.77'>77</span>chance. If ever I am a cutler, I will try that
way, if I can get anybody else of the same mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not you,” said Bill; “you will do like the
people before you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps I may, when the time comes. I
may no more like to try my hand at a new thing
than you. Have you asked anybody for work
hereabouts?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The flock is all sold, higher up the country,”
replied Bill. “They would not let me stay on
the walk when the flock was gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know that; and how you got it into your
head that you might go on sleeping in the hut
just the same when the place was a field as when
it was a sheep-walk. They say they had to
take you neck and heels to turn you out, if you
would not have the roof down over your head.
Why did not you bestir yourself in time, and
get work from Anderson, before others stepped
before you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are no sheep now for anybody to keep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; if you have no mind to do anything
but keep sheep, cannot you go higher up, among
the graziers, and offer yourself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know anybody thereabouts, nor yet
the walks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, nor ever will, of your own accord,”
thought John. “What would you be now, Bill,
if you might never be a shepherd again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bill only rubbed his hand over the back of his
head, and shifted his weight from both legs to
one. Few things could daunt John’s love of
talk.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.78'>78</span>“What became of the poor little lamb you
were nursing that night that I was on the moors?
It was too tender, surely, to walk up into the
hills with the rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It be well if he be not dead by this time,”
replied Bill. “I carried him full two miles
myself, and I told ’em how to feed him and
when; and, for all I could say, they minded no
more when he complained—O, they don’t understand
him no more than if he was a puppy-dog.
When I bid him good-bye, he looked up at me,
though he could scarce speak to me. He did
speak, though; but he would not so much as
look at the new shepherd, and if it was not for
the ewe——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s coming?” cried John, interrupting
his companion’s new loquacity. “Let us go and
see. I dare say it is somebody fresh taken up.
Do you know, I went to see Chatham’s jail, the
other day. Father locked doors against me because
I came home so late; but I had a mind to
see what sort of a place it was. I may be in it
some day. I should not mind being anywhere
that Chatham has been.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You that can’t stand being flogged!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Chatham is not going to be flogged. They
say it will be ‘Death Recorded.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Transportation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why can’t they say so at once?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know: but they often speak in the
same way. I have heard Chatham say that they
talk of ‘agriculture,’ and nobody means just the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.79'>79</span>same as they do by it. Some say ’tis farmers,
and some say ’tis landlords, and some that ’tis
having corn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think it is keeping sheep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no; the Parliament does not meddle
with keeping sheep. When they are asked to
‘protect agriculture,’ Chatham says, Anderson
understands, ‘take care of the farmer;’ and
Mr. Fergusson, ‘have an eye to the landlords,’
and all the rest of us,—except you, you say,—let
us have <a id='corr79.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='corn.”'>corn.’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_79.11'><ins class='correction'>corn.’”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Bill yawned, and supposed it was all one.
John being of a different opinion, and seeing that
a very knowing personage of the village, who
vouchsafed him a word or two on occasion, was
flourishing a newspaper out of the window of the
public-house, ran off to try whether the doubtful
definition was likely to be mended by the wise
men of the Cock and Gun.</p>

<p class='c001'>He found that there was a grand piece of news
going from mouth to mouth, and that everybody
seemed much pleased at it. He did not know,
when he had heard it, what it meant; but as the
hand which held the newspaper shook very much,
and two or three men waved their hats, and
women came running from their doors, and even
the little children clapped their hands and hugged
one another, he had no doubt of its being a very
fine piece of news indeed. Bill had slowly followed,
and was now watching what John meant
to do next.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t believe they have heard it at the
foundry yet,” thought John. “I’ll be the first
to tell it them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.80'>80</span>And off he ran, followed by Bill, and gradually
gained upon by him. Now, Bill’s legs were
some inches longer than little John’s, and, if he
had the mind, there was no doubt he might be
the first at the foundry to tell the news. This
would have been very provoking, and the little
runner put out all his strength, looking back
fearfully over his shoulder, stumbling in consequence,
and falling; rising as cold with the
shock as he was warm when he fell, and running
on again, rubbing his knee, and thinking how far
he should be from hobbling like Bill, (with
head hung back, bent knees, and dangling arms,)
if he had Bill’s capacity of limb. What Bill
wanted was the heart to use his capacities. He
soon gave over the race, even against his little
friend John, first slackening his speed, and then
contriving to miss the bustle both before and behind
him by stopping to lean over a rail which
looked convenient for a lounge.</p>

<p class='c001'>John snapped his fingers triumphantly at the
lazy shepherd-boy on reaching the foundry gate.
He rushed in, disregarding all the usual decorums
about obtaining entrance. Through the
paved yard ran John, and into the huge vault
where the furnaces were roaring, and where all
the workmen looked so impish that it was no
wonder he did not immediately discover his father
among them. He nearly ran foul of one who
was bearing a ladle of molten metal of a white
heat, and set his foot on the exquisitely levelled
sand-bed which was prepared to form the plate.
Scolded on one side, jostled on another, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.81'>81</span>breathless boy could only ask eagerly for his
father.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let go the lad’s collar,” cried one of the
workmen to another, adding in a low voice,
“’Tis some mishap about his poor mother.
Can’t ye help him to find his father?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kay was roasting and fuming in the red
glare of one of the furnaces when his boy’s wide
eyes looked up in his face, while he cried,</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s such news, father! The greatest
news there has been this many a day. There’s
an Order in Council, father; and the people are
all about the Cock and Gun, and the newspaper
is being read, and everybody coming out of their
houses. Only think, father! It is certainly
true. There is an Order in Council.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“An Order in Council! Well, what of that?
What is the Order about?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“About? O, they did not say what it is
about,—at least, nobody that I heard speaking.
But I’ll run back and ask, directly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will do no such thing. You would
bring back only half your story. What should a
child know about an Order in Council?” he
asked of his fellow-workmen, who began to
gather round. “Can’t one of you go and learn
what it is he means?—for I suppose some news
is really come; and I can’t leave the furnace just
now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>John slunk away mortified to a corner where
he could spread wet sand, in case any passing
workman should be bountiful enough to spare
him the brimmings of some overflowing ladle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.82'>82</span>It was very odd that his father did not seem to
understand his news when everybody, down to the
very babies, seemed to be so glad of it at the
Cock and Gun.</p>

<p class='c001'>The messenger soon returned, and then the
tidings produced all the effects that the veriest
newsmonger could have desired. John ceased
his sand-levelling to creep near and listen how
there had been issued an Order in Council for
opening the ports, and allowing the importation
of foreign grain. There was a great buzz of
voices, and that of the furnace was the loudest
of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now you hear, lad,” said one of the boy’s
tormentors. “The Order is for the importation
of foreign grain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just as if I did not know that half-an-hour
ago,” said John solemnly. “Why, I was at
the Cock and Gun the minute after the news
came.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the lad rescued himself from the man’s
grasp; and went in search of some one else
whom he might throw into a state of admiration.
He met Mr. Oliver himself, saying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is all this about? The people stand
in the heat as if it was no more than a warm
bath; and my work is spoiling all the time, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are talking about the news, sir,—the
great news that is just come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“News? What news?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The King is going to unbar the forts, sir;
and he allows the importance of foreign grain.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.83'>83</span>“It is high time he should. Your father and
I have seen the importance you speak of, this
long while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll warrant you have, sir. And now, perhaps,
father will let me go and see it, if you
speak a word to him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Oliver laughed, and told him he would
probably see more of it than he liked as he grew
up. John thought he had rather not wait till
then to see the sight; besides that he thought
it hardly likely that the King should go on unlocking
forts all that time. The fort that he
could just remember to have seen, when his
grandfather once took him a journey, might, he
believed, be unlocked in five minutes. The
young politician proceeded on his rounds, hoping
to find a dull person here and there, who had
rather go on with his castings, and be talked to,
than flock with the rest round the main furnace.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, good fellows,” said Mr. Oliver,
“what is your opinion of this news?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That it is good, sir, as far as it goes; and that
it will be better, if it teaches some folks to make
such laws as will not starve people first, and then
have to be broken at last.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The laws chop and change so that it seems
to me overhard to punish a man for breaking
them,” observed another. “That law against
buying corn when it is wanted is bad enough in
the best times, as we can all tell; but if you want
damning proof, look to the fact that they are
obliged to contradict it upon occasion;—not once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.84'>84</span>only, but many times;—as often as it has
wrought so well as to produce starvation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kay thought, that putting out a little temporary
law upon a great lasting one, was like sending
a messenger after a kite,—which proves it
ill-made and unlikely to sustain itself. Somebody
wondered what Fergusson would think of
the news.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What matters it to us what he thinks?” answered
another. “He has stood too long between
us and our food;—not knowingly, perhaps;
but not the less certainly for that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Oliver wished that his men could talk over
their own case without abusing their neighbours.
He would not stand and hear a word against Mr.
Fergusson on these premises.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then let us say nothing about Mr. Fergusson,
sir, for whom, as is due, I have a high respect.
When I mentioned him, I meant him as the receiver
of a very high rent; and I maintain that
if we make corn by manufacturing, with fire and
water, what will buy corn, we are robbed if we
have not bread. Deny that who can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the speaker brandished his brawny arm,
and thrust forward his shining face in the glowing
light, to see if any one accepted his challenge.
But all were of the same mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Oliver, however, observed that, though he
had as little cause as any one to relish the disproportionate
prosperity of the landlords in a time
of general distress, he wished not to forget that
they were brought up to look to their rent as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.85'>85</span>to look to the returns of his capital, and his men
to their wages.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the very thing I complain of,” said
Kay; “that is, I complain of the amount of
rent thus looked for. In as far as a landowner’s
property is the natural fruit of his own and his
ancestors’ labour and services,—or accidents of
war and state, if you will,—let him have it and
enjoy it, so long as it interferes with no other
man’s property, held on as good a claim. But if
by a piece of management this rent is increased
out of another man’s funds, the increase is not
‘property,’—I take it,—but stolen goods. If a
man has a shopkeeping business, with the capital,
left him, the whole is his property, as long as
he deals fairly; but if he uses any power he may
have to prevent people buying of his neighbours,
and thus puts any price he pleases upon his goods,
do you mean to say that his customers may not
get leave if they can to buy at other shops, without
any remorse as to how the great shopkeeper
may take such meddling with his ‘property?’
Give us a free trade in corn, and our landowners
shall be heartily welcome to the best rents they
can get. But, till that is done, we will not pretend
to agree in making them a present of more of the
fruits of our labour the more we want ourselves.
The fruits of our labour are as much our property
as their rents are theirs, to say the least; and if
it was anything but food that was in question we
would not be long in proving it; but food is just
the thing we cannot do without, and we cannot
hold out long enough to prove our point.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.86'>86</span>“They will find it all out soon,” replied Mr.
Oliver. “Whatever is ruinous for many of us
must be bad for all; and such men as Fergusson
will see this before long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They will not see it, sir, till they feel it; and
what a pass <em>we</em> must have come to before they
will feel enough to give up a prejudice some
hundred years old!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Before we can ask them to give up the point
entirely, we must relieve them of some of the
taxes which bear particularly upon them. Their
great cry is about the weight of their taxation.
They must first be relieved in that respect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With all my heart. Let them go free of
taxation as great folks, in the same way that my
wife and Mary are let off free at cards on Christmas
night, because they are women. This was
the case with the old French nobility, I have
heard. They paid no taxes; and so let it be
with our landowners, if they choose to accept the
favour of having their burdens borne by the
sweating people to whom they would not own
themselves obliged in respect of money matters if
they met in the churchyard, though the time may
not be far off when they must lie side by side
under the sod.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Their pride must be pretty well humbled before
they would accept of that kind of obligation.
They had need go to church, in those days, to
learn to bear the humiliation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps that is what they go to church for
now, sir; for they are now taking much more
from us than they would in the case I have mentioned.
I don’t say they all do it knowingly,—nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.87'>87</span>half of them. There are many of our rich
men who would be offended enough at being
told, ‘Your eldest son’s bills at Eton were paid
last year by contributions from three hedgers,
and five brass-founders, and seven weavers, all of
whom have families only half-fed.’ ‘Miss Isabella’s
beautiful bay mare was bought for her by
the knife-grinder, who has gone to bed supperless,
and the work-woman who will have no fire
next winter, and the thirty little children who
are kept from school that Miss Isabella’s bay
mare may be bought.’ O yes; there are many
who are too proud to bear this being said to
them, true though it be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They would call you a leveller, Kay, if they
could hear you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I should beg leave to contradict them;
for a leveller I am not.—I have no objection on
earth to young gentlemen going to Eton, or
young ladies riding bay mares, if these things
are paid for by the natural rent which a free
trade in corn would leave. If we have that free
trade, and workpeople still go to bed supperless
and sit up without fire, still let young gentlemen
go to Eton, and young ladies ride bay mares.
In that case, the landlords will be absolved, and
the hardship must go to the account of imprudence
in some other quarter. O, I am no leveller!
Let the rich keep their estates, as long as
they will let them find their own value in comparison
with labour. It is the making and keeping
up laws which make land of more and more
value, and labour of less and less, that I complain
of.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.88'>88</span>“But you did not really mean, Kay,” said a
bystander, “that you would let off every man
that has land from paying taxes? It is the most
unfair thing I ever heard of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is unfair enough, but much less unfair and
ruinous than the present plan. It is better
worth our while to pay the landowners’ taxes
than to lose ten times the amount to enable the
landowners to pay them; and that is what we
are doing now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ten times as much as the landlords pay in
taxes?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” replied Oliver. “We pay, as a nation,
12,500,000<i>l.</i> more for corn than we should
pay if our ports were open to the world. Of
this, not more than one-fifth goes into the pockets
of the landowners, the rest being, for the most
part, buried in poor soils. Now if the landlords
pay one-half of this fifth in taxes, it is as much
as their burden can be supposed to be. And
now, which of you would not be glad to take his
share of this one-tenth, to get rid of the other
nine?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Every one of us would go down on his knees
to pray the landlords to permit us to pay their
taxes, if we could but tell how to get at the gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The landlords would need no such begging
and praying, I trust,” said Mr. Oliver, “if they
saw the true state of the case. I hope and
believe they would be in a hurry to surrender
their other tenth, if they could see at what an
expense to the people it was raised.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.89'>89</span>Some heartily believed it, but Kay asked why
the landowners did not see the state of the case;—a
question which it was not easy to answer,
unless it was that they did not attend to it. And
why did they not attend to it?—attend to it, not
merely so far as to sanction an Order in Council
for the admission of food when the people were
on the brink of starvation, but so as to calculate
justly how much corn we grow, how many of
our people are properly fed upon that corn, how
we may most cheaply get more corn, and——(but
that is a matter beyond human calculation)—how
many more busy and happy people might
live within our borders if we and the other parts
of the earth had free access to each other. If
our rich men once attended to this large question,
they would see what we see; and seeing, they
would surrender, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And be far richer, as well as happier, than
they are now. But, never fear! They will feel
soon; and feeling helps seeing marvellously.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was found so in the case of the bounty on
the exportation of corn. The landowning legislators
thought they saw plainly enough, once upon a
time, that it was a capital thing for all parties to
give a present to every man who would sell corn
abroad:—it would employ more hands in tillage
than were employed before; it would secure a
supply in case of scarcity; it would increase the
value of landed property by causing the greatest
possible quantity of land to be cultivated. This is
what they saw in vision,—or rather through a pair
of flawed spectacles. It ended in the labourers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.90'>90</span>producing only half as much wealth in a forced
tillage as they might have made in manufactures,
if food had been free; in exposing us
to the danger of famine, as often as the deficiency
of the crops exceeded what we sent out of the
country, (no other nation being prepared to send
us corn in a hurry, as if we were regular buyers;)
and lastly, in sending a great deal of capital out
of this country into others where living was
cheaper. At first, no doubt, tillage was brisk,
and some of the objects seemed to be answered:
but this that I have described was the end. Then
the landlords saw, for the first time, that, in giving
the bounty to our corn-sellers, they had been
offering a bribe to foreigners to buy our corn
cheaper than we could afford to sell it. A pretty
bargain for us! So that pair of flawed spectacles
broke to pieces on being examined, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now they must break another pair before
they will learn that they can see best with the
eyes God gave them, if they will but put them
to the right use. I am not for spectacles, unless
there is something the matter with the eyes.
And, in the same way, I am not for any man
helping himself with the opinions of a class
because he belongs to a class, unless he has such
a faulty reason of his own that he would do
worse if left to judge for himself. Let such of
our landowners as are incompetent go on upholding
the corn laws because their class has always
done so; but let such of them as are men stand
out, and judge for themselves, after looking the
case plainly in the face. I am not afraid of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.91'>91</span>what their judgment would be, especially as some
of the richest and wisest have done so already.
Honour be upon them!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The men were perhaps the more disposed to
give honour where honour was due from their
notion of the smallness of the number of landowners
in those days to whom they could award
it. They gave three cheers to the Privy Council
for having issued the present Order; and to the
few landowners who advocated a free trade in
corn. That done, they began to inquire what
this order was to do for them, and found that it
would just serve to avert the starvation of the
people, now, and might probably lead to the ruin
of a good many farmers within a few months;
which ruin must be ascribed, should it arrive, not
to the Order in Council, but to the previous state
of things which it was designed to repair. Prices
had been rising so rapidly from week to week
since the quarterly average had been taken, that
there was no saying how far even oats might be
out of the reach of the poorer classes, before the
next quarterly average could be struck, and prices
be proved to have risen to the point at which the
law authorized the importation of corn. To save
the people from perishing while waiting for the
quarter to come round, this order was issued
without leave of parliament; and, as it would
have the effect of lessening the general panic, in
the first place, and also of bringing a large supply
into the kingdom, the probability was that the
farmers would, find prices falling by spring-time,
rapidly,—ruinously for them, calculating as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.92'>92</span>had done on high prices continuing till next
harvest, and laying their plans of expense accordingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>But all this would be a fine thing for Oliver,
would not it?</p>

<p class='c001'>In as far as cheaper living was a good to him
and his people, and in as far as more manufactures
would be wanted to go abroad, it would be a
benefit; but fluctuations in the fortunes of any
class of society,—be they farmers or any body
else,—are bad for the rest of society. For every
farmer that is ruined, the manufacturing and
commercial world suffers; and Mr. Oliver would
rather therefore,—not only that corn had not
been so dear as it now was,—but that it should
not be so cheap as it might now soon be, unless
its cheapness could be maintained. Fluctuations
apart, the cheaper the better; but it was a strange
and unhappy way of going on, first to ruin one
class by high prices, and then to ruin another by
low prices.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this was allowed to be very true; yet the
substantial fact remained, that the day of the
manufacturer and mechanic was probably approaching,
and that a season of cheap bread was
in prospect, let what might follow in its train in
the shape of disastrous consequence.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was enough to proceed upon in rejoicing,
and when the furnaces had been duly fed, by
strong and willing hands, and a few plates cast
amid more talking than was usual during so nice
an operation, Oliver’s day-men turned out like
school-boys on a holiday morning, and tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.93'>93</span>which could get first to the Cock and Gun. There
they stood, regardless of the chill of the breeze
after the heats of the foundry. How could they
be sensible to it when they felt that the icy grasp
of poverty on their heartstrings was relaxing, and
the warm currents of hope had leave again to
flow?</p>

<p class='c001'>Kay was not one of the talkers at the public
house. It was so long since he had had any
pleasant news to carry home, that he was
impatient to lose no time about it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was one of Mrs. Kay’s dismal days. She
seldom made any complaints; but there were
times when the tears would run down her face
for hours together, while there appeared to be no
particular reason; and she sometimes said she
could not account for it herself. On those occasions,
she was not moody, or disposed to speak
by signs rather than words, as was often her
way; she would speak, and move about, and even
try to laugh; but still the tears would run down,
and she was obliged to give the matter up. Thus
it was to-day, though Mary had not yet parted
with the hope that, between them, they might stop
the tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Which way did John run?” asked Mary.
“Did you happen to see, sister?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Down by the coal wharf, I think,” she replied,
speaking rapidly. “O yes, it must have been
by the coal wharf, because——No; it was
not; that was yesterday. It could not have been
to-day, because his father bade him go up the lane
to gather acorns for the pig. That I should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.94'>94</span>forgot it was yesterday he went to the wharf!
But that is always the way with my head. It is
so——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will be better when you have tried the
medicine from the dispensary a little longer.
What a kind, pleasant gentleman that is at the
dispensary! He told me he really believed you
would be better directly, if——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall never be better,—never,—head nor
heart, till I see these poor children of mine——and
my husband too——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well well: cheer up! They will be better
fed soon, please God. Don’t let that trouble you
<a id='corr94.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to night'>to-night</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_94.14'><ins class='correction'>to-night</ins></a></span>, when you feel yourself not strong.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And there’s Chatham too. That lies at my
heart, Mary, more than you know. I must tell
you so, for you have been a kind sister to me
and mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be sorry it should lie so heavy at
your heart,” said Mary, very quietly. “I thank
you for him; but you must not make yourself
unhappy about me. I am thinking your husband
will be home soon. The sun has been down some
good while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After a silence, she went on:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“You should have seen Betsy this morning,
how prettily she made the bed, though she could
scarce reach up to the bolster. Did you happen
to look how she set about it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No. I have been thinking, Mary, how completely
you and I are changed. It is not so long
since you used to check me for talking; or rather,
I used to check myself, seeing that you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.95'>95</span>no talker. You used to say that people were
not all made talkers alike; and you went up and
down, and about the house, just like a dumb
person, and sometimes looking as dull too. And
now——I say, Mary, when I don’t answer you,
you must not always think that I am thankless.
And I know what it must cost you to be for ever
saying something cheerful and pleasant, when
Chatham is in gaol, and the cupboard is so often
empty, and I such a poor, good-for-nothing——No,
no! Don’t try to persuade me. I tell you
I can’t bear myself, and I don’t ask you or any
body to bear with me. Mercy! now here’s my
husband! and I in this condition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Heyday! it is time I was coming home, I
see,” cried Kay, good humouredly, as he entered.
“You too, Mary! Well, dear, you have cause,
so don’t turn away; I have only wondered to see
none of this before; but I have something for
you both. Something we have not had this
many a-day. Something better than ever was
in this or any other physic bottle,” he continued,
shaking the dispensary phial and telling
the news.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary had no sooner made herself mistress of
it than she disappeared, probably to devise the
means of getting the intelligence conveyed to her
lover. As soon as she was gone, Kay drew a
chair beside his wife, saying,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now we are alone, Margaret, and times are
like to change, so as to give one the heart to
speak, I have something to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.96'>96</span>“O, no, don’t,” cried she, starting up. “I
know what you are going to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not;” and he obliged her to sit
down. “Don’t tremble so, for I am not going
to find fault with you in any way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you ought. I am a poor, lost——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not lost, Margaret. We have all near lost
ourselves in such times as we have had of late;
except indeed Mary, who will never lose herself,
it is my opinion. It has come across me, Margaret,
that I may have hurt you sometimes, without
thinking, with light talk when you had not
spirits for it, (not that I had real spirits, for that
matter,) and with saying silly things to Mrs.
Skipper, and the like. Ah! I see you felt it so;
and it is no wonder you should. But you may
take my word for it, I think nothing of Mrs.
Skipper, nor ever did. Only, one is driven on,
one does not know how, to behave foolishly when
one is near desperate at heart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And that’s my fault.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not altogether. No! not by any means.
There were many things besides—besides one—to
make me unwilling to look back to the time
when we used to walk in Fergusson’s oak copse,
and say——Nay, Margaret, if you cannot hold
up your head in thinking of that time, where
should you rest it but upon your husband’s shoulder,
as you did then? How can you turn away
so, as if I was your enemy? Well, I turned
away too from the thought of those days, knowing,
all the while, that it was a bad sign to turn away.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.97'>97</span>“And to think of all that has happened since!
Of all these children, and of my being such a
bad mother——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was the children I most wanted to speak
about, especially John. But come, now, Margaret,
open your mind to me, and don’t be afraid.
It was want and downright weakness that first
led you into it. Was not it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, it began long and long ago. When I
was weakly as a girl, they used to give me things,
and that was the beginning of it all. Then when
I grew weakly again, it seemed to come most
natural, especially because it was cheaper than
bread, and the children wanted all we could get
of that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So, often when you have pretended to have
no appetite, it was for the children’s sake and
mine. Well, I half thought so all the time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, not often; only at the beginning. Afterwards
it was true that I could not eat,—no,
not if the king’s dinner had been before me. I
did try for long to get the better of the habit,
and three times I thought I had; but a sinking
came, and I could not bear it. That was twice;
and the third time, it was your joking sharply
about——But that was no reason. I don’t mean
to say it was. You don’t know what the support
is for the time, John, whatever comes after it.
It raises one; and yet I remember times—many
times—when I knew I could not speak sensibly
if you spoke to me, and yet I prayed and prayed
that I might die before the morning light.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.98'>98</span>“Does that mean that you were less afraid of
God than of me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I did not think of being afraid, exactly;
but I wanted to be out of your way and the
children’s; and, for my own part, I should have
been very glad to be at rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After a long pause, John resumed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You said you tried three times to leave it off.
Do you think you could try again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, John, I do not think I could.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not for my sake,—as you say I drove you
into it last time? Not for your own sake? for
nobody knows but ourselves, I dare say. I have
never breathed it, and Mary——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Mary has vexed me many a time,—taking
such pains, and having so many reasons and excuses
with the neighbours. Why,—do you suppose
I never met anybody? And then there was
the night that Mrs. Skipper, of all people in the
world, gave me her arm. I was forced to take
it, but——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mrs. Skipper! Really! She never breathed
a word. Depend upon it, she never told any
body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If she did not, I am sure I have told plenty
of people myself: so don’t say any more about
it, John.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was just going to say, that now is the time
for trying. We are going to have better living,
I hope, which is what you will want; and I am
sure Mary and I do not care what there is for us,
if we could see you recover. If you will only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.99'>99</span>give us the word, we will watch and watch, night
and day; and you shall have all manner of help,
and comfort, and no more thoughts of cruel joking
or of Mrs. Skipper. O, Margaret, try!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am almost sure I cannot,” muttered the
poor woman; “but I will just try.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! do, and I should not wonder.—You
talk of being at rest; and it may be a rest in this
very room,—on that very bed,—such as you little
thought of when you wished your wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Margaret shook her head. “If I go on, I die;
if I leave off, I die; it is all one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, Margaret, it is not all one; for I have
one more thing to say,—and the chief thing. The
children do not fully understand yet, though I
have seen John wonder-struck lately, and his
aunt could not put him off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why should she?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just because neither she nor I choose that
the children should grow used to see drunkenness
before their eyes indifferently. I speak
plain, because it is about those who cannot
speak for themselves. Do you know now what
I mean to say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean to say, (and to do it too,) that as
often as I see you not yourself, I shall tell the
children, not that their mother is ill, or low-spirited,
or any thing else,—but what is really the
case. Now, Margaret, how will you bear this?
Remember I shall really do it, from this day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Margaret made no answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know I cannot let our children’s morals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.100'>100</span>get corrupted at home, and them ruined for here
and hereafter by such a habit as this. I cannot,
Margaret.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; you cannot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure they have enough against them,
at the best,—what with poverty,(temptation and
no proper instruction,) and sometimes idleness,
and sometimes over-work. They have enough
before them at the best.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They have.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And who have they to look to but you and
me? except Mary, and she would not set against
your example. It goes against my heart more
than you know to say an unkind word to you,
and always did, when I seemed cruel. But I can
say what you will think cruel, and I must, unless
you take my warning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not know——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I know, down to the bottom of my
soul, what the misery was, and how many,
many excuses there are for you. But the children
do not know this, and there is no making
them understand, and I must think of them first.
If it was only myself, I think I could sit up with
you all night, and shield you all day, and even
indulge you with the very thing itself, when I
saw you sinking for want of it. But, as it is,
whatever I may do when the children are out of
the way, I will do as I said when they are by.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do. I was not going to excuse myself when
you stopped me just now,—but only to say you
do not know how glad I should be to stop, if I
could, though I shall never recover my head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.101'>101</span>again now. It will go on roaring like the sea
as long as ever I live.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no. With good food, you know——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall never relish food more; but I will
try; and do you do as you said. I am not sure
how I shall mind it in such a case; I never can
tell any thing beforehand now. But you know
your part; and if I fall back, you must all mind
me as little as you can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only, don’t think me less tender to you,
Margaret.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; O, no; you have given me warning,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your poor head! how it beats! You had
better let me carry you to bed; you are not fit to
sit up. Better let me lay you on the bed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I can’t go walking. This is the sinking,—now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And enough there has been to sink you.
There! I’ll stay beside you. Where’s your apron
to hang up before your eyes? Now, don’t think
of any thing but sleep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, but then I dream.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well! I shall be here to wake you, in case
of your starting. Only just give me the key of
the cupboard, and do not ask Mary for it any
more when I am away.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>On a bright morning of the following May, the
stroke of the wood-cutter’s axe had resounded
through Fergusson’s woods from day-break till
the sun was high. More than one fine young
tree which had shaken off the gathered dews at
the first greeting of the morning light, now lay
prostrate, no more to be refreshed by midnight
dews, no more to uprear its leafy top in the
early sunshine. Such seemed to meet with little
pity in their fall. The very men whose hands
had felled them sat down on their horizontal
trunks, and kicked the bark with their clownish
heels, while they munched their bread and cheese.
Children dropped into the green recess from all
quarters, to pluck oak boughs and leaves from
the fallen stem, wherewith to ornament their hats,
and lead a procession to the neighbouring Whit
Monday fair. These trees should have flourished
twenty, fifty, seventy years longer, if the affairs
of their owner had gone on in a steady and natural
course. When Mr. Fergusson had walked
round his plantations to see these oaks put into
the ground, his thoughts had glanced forward to
the time when his descendants might give a last
mournful look at the doomed trees, towering
stately before their fall; and now he was compelled
himself to sentence them to the axe before
they had attained nearly the fullness of their massive
growth. Frequent and sudden losses during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.103'>103</span>the last few months, and the prospect of more
had obliged Mr. Fergusson to collect all his resources,
or surrender some of his domestic plans.
He must sacrifice either a portion of his woods
or the completion of the new buildings at the
Abbey. His oaks must be felled, or his sons
give up some of the advantages of education that
he had promised them. It was found impossible
to collect two-thirds of the rent due to him; and
the condition of his farms foretold too plainly
that further deficiencies <a id='corr103.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wonld'>would</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_103.11'><ins class='correction'>would</ins></a></span> ensue. Poppies
flourished more luxuriantly than ever this season
among the thin-springing corn in Anderson’s new
fields. The sheep had returned to their old
haunts, and could not be kept out by the untended
walls and ricketty gates which reminded
the passenger of the field of the slothful. When
Mr. Fergusson was disposed to stop in his walks
for purposes of meditation, he could hardly choose
his station better than within sight of one of
Anderson’s enclosures when any rapacious sheep
happened to covet what was within. It was a
sight of monotony to behold one sheep after
another follow the adventurous one, each in turn
placing its fore-feet on the breach in the fence,
bringing up its hind legs after it, looking around
for an instant from the summit, and then making
the plunge into the dry ditch, tufted with locks
of wool. The process might have been more
composing if the field had been another man’s
property, or if the flock had been making its way
out instead of in; but the recollection of the
scene of transit served to send the landowner to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.104'>104</span>sleep more than once, when occurring at the end
of the train of anxious thoughts which had kept
him awake. There was little sleepiness, however,
in the tone with which he called his tenant to
account for letting his property thus go to destruction.
Mr. Fergusson was as near losing his
temper as he ever was, when he pointed out to
Anderson a ditch here that was choked up in one
part and overflowing in another; a gate, whose
stuffing of briars was proved a mockery by the
meddling children who had unhooked it from its
lower hinge, and the groping swine which enlarged
the gap thus made; and the cattle-sheds,
roofless and grass-grown, which should be either
pulled down or repaired. Anderson’s tone was
also high, as he declared that a half-ruined man
could not keep his farm in as thrifty a manner as
a prosperous one; and that if, as soon as he
began to improve the property he held, his funds
melted away beneath the fluctuations of the corn-market,
it was unreasonable to expect him to
spend his capital in repairs till he should see
whether government would or would not do
something to protect agriculture from the consequences
of vicissitude. Fergusson thought it
useless to wait, on this ground. Government had
been protecting agriculture for some hundreds of
years, and yet fluctuations there had always been,
and fluctuations there would always be, to judge
by all experience. Anderson was not for this the
less resolved to let his roofless cow-sheds and
crumbling fences stand,—to be rebuilt if government
should extend its protecting care,—to stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.105'>105</span>as monuments, if agriculture should be neglected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Monuments of what?—Anderson was a proud
man, building for his own and his family’s honour
and glory when he was in prosperity, and finding
something to be proud of in adversity;—Anderson
would therefore have replied—‘monuments of
injury.’ Injury from an act of government by
which the starving were rescued from destitution,
and the oppressed allowed one more chance of
the redemption of their fortunes. That act which
all other classes received as one of tardy justice,—of
absolute necessity,—Anderson complained of
as an act of injury to himself, so deep that he
left certain wrecks of his property to serve as
tokens to a future race of the wrongs he had
suffered.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the fortunes of Anderson <em>were</em> injured,—and
injured by the acts of government, though
not, as his wisest friends thought, so much by
the permission of importation as by the preceding
restrictions. They rightly called his wrecks and
ruins monuments of his ill-luck in speculation, as
their poorer neighbours called them monuments
of the injustice done to the productive classes by
encouraging or compelling the disadvantageous
investment of capital. Both parties were right:
but Anderson was induced to speculate by acts of
protection which failed in the proof; and the disadvantageous
application of capital, originating
in the same acts, issued in disaster to all parties.
If the interests of Anderson were placed in apparent
or real temporary opposition to those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.106'>106</span>his neighbours, the blame rested, not with him,
but with the legislation which had interfered to
derange the natural harmonies of social interests;
which had impaired the loyalty and embittered
the spirits of artizans, curtailed the usefulness and
enjoyments of manufacturers, puffed up the
farmer with the pride, first of ostentation and
then of injury, and compelled the landowner to
lay low his young woods before they had attained
half their growth.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was but little prospect of improvement
in Anderson’s affairs for a long time to come.
There had been enormous importations of corn
during the winter,—importations which in the
end proved as ruinous to the corn-dealer as to the
farmer at home. The bargain with foreign corn-growers
having been made in a panic was
agreed upon at a panic price. The foreigners
had naturally laid heavy duties on corn, both
because it was known how much the English
wanted food, and because what they bought was
not a surplus regularly grown for sale, but a part
of the stock of the countries they bought of.
In the midst of a panic, and in entire uncertainty
how long the ports might be open, the corn
importers could not possibly calculate how much
would be wanted, any more than the people
ascertain how much was brought in. While all
were thus in the dark, prices fell in the home
market, till wheat which sold at all sold at 50<i>s.</i>
per quarter, and much was left which was not
even bid for. The importer’s foreign debts must,
however, be paid. He was unwilling to warehouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.107'>107</span>his wheat, because there was promise of a
fine home harvest for this year, and the perishable
nature of his commodity rendered it unwise for
him to store it against some future contingency.
The only thing for him to do, therefore, was to
obtain a drawback on what he had imported, and
to export it at a lower price than he had paid for
it, pronouncing himself and every body else a
fool that had entered upon so ruinous a branch of
commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>This resource of exportation would fail in
Anderson’s case, if his harvest should prove
never so flourishing. The high average price at
home, caused by dependence on home growth, disables
the home producer for competition in a
foreign market, even if the uncertainty of a sale
attending so irregular a commerce did not deter
him from the attempt. A capricious demand
abroad is the necessary consequence of alternate
monopoly and relaxation at home; and when to
this uncertainty is added the impediment of a
higher average price, and the disadvantage of the
known desire of the seller to sell, so small a
chance of remuneration is left, that Anderson
could not look with any confidence to this mode
of disposing of the superabundance of his next
crop. No great increase of demand at home was
to be expected in the course of one season, as
people cannot eat much more bread immediately
because there happens to be a good supply, however
certain an ultimate increase of demand may
be, as the consequence of a single fruitful year.
All that Anderson could look forward to, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.108'>108</span>was waiting in hope of future temporary
high prices, unless, indeed, all parties should
grow so wise as to agree upon a freedom of trade
which should secure permanent good profits to
the farmers. Meantime, as capital invested in
agricultural improvements is much less easily
withdrawn and converted to other purposes than
capital applied in manufactures, it was but too
probable that the profits of Anderson’s prosperous
years were buried in useless drains and fences,
and in stony soils, while he was burdened with an
increased rent and a family now accustomed to a
lavish expenditure. It was to be feared that
more of Fergusson’s young oaks must be brought
low to supply the deficiencies of the tenant’s half-yearly
payments to his landlord.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woodmen who sat on the fallen trunks
thought little, while enjoying their meal and their
joke, of all that was included in the fact of these
trees having fallen.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some talked of the work done and to be done
this day. Others had thoughts at liberty for the
fair to which so many persons within view were
hastening; and yet others had eyes wherewith to
look beyond the green slope where they were
sitting, and to mark signs of the times in whatever
they saw;—the whirling mill, with one or two
additional powdered persons on the steps, or
appearing at the windows;—the multiplication
of the smokes of Sheffield;—the laden lighters
below Kirkland’s granaries;—Anderson’s fields,
waving green before the breeze;—sheep and
cows grazing where there was to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.109'>109</span>corn;—and, above all, Chatham taking his way
to the accustomed quarry, in a very unaccustomed
manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do look at that fellow, walking as if he was
mazed,” said Jack to Hal. “He is not like one
bound for the fair. He is on his way to work,
seemingly; but what a lagging step for one
going to his work!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t you see ’tis Chatham?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more like Chatham than you. And yet
it is,—yes,—that it is! You may know by the
way his arm is stuck in his side. But that is not
the gait Chatham used to have.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, because he never took such a queer walk
before. Don’t you know he has been between
four walls all these many months, and has but
just got out? I have heard a man say that knew
well, that the blue sky is a new sky when you
have been shut out from it for a long while: and
the grass seems really alive; and as for such
boughs as this that dance in the wind, you could
almost think they were going to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Chatham seems to be fancying some such
thing, he pays so little heed. If he is not going
to pass without seeing us!—without once looking
up into the wood! His thoughts are all in the
middle of the vale. I’ll step down, and have a
chat with him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the last mouthful was stuffed into the
mouth of the speaker, however, in preparation
for descending to the road, livelier sounds than
any that it was in his power to make, roused
Chatham from his reverie. A train of little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.110'>110</span>boys and girls, who had disappeared a few minutes
before, issued from the neighbouring sawpit, and
from behind the piles of planks which lay around,
their hats and bonnets stuck round with oak-leaves,
and their procession of boughs arranged
in boy and girl style. As each one scrambled
out of the pit, there was a shout; as they ranged
themselves, there was more shouting; and as
they marched down the green slope on their way
to the fair, there was the most shouting of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t think Chatham seems to relish his
walk so much as you thought for,” said Jack to
Hal. “He looks mighty melancholy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! laughing at the brats. And look!
he is nodding to one and another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Melancholy enough, for all that. For such
a fine-made man, he is a hollow-faced, poor-looking
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just now. When he has been three months
at his work, you will see the difference.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a lucky thing for him to have stepped
into his work so naturally, as if he had only left
it just from Saturday night till Monday morning.
That is more than happens to many men who
have been in prison. There was Joe Wilson
never got the better of it, though he was only in
a month. Not a stroke more of work did he
get.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because his was for stealing, and nobody
could trust him afterwards. In Chatham’s case,
no one thinks he did or meant any harm, considering
what the pressure of the times was.
And if the masters believed that he had really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.111'>111</span>broken the law, they would have had no objection
to take him on again, in consideration of the
cause, which they view as in some measure their
own, against the farmers and landlords.
Chatham is pretty sure of work at all times; but
if he had been the worst workman in all
Yorkshire, he would have had plenty of masters
courting him for having been punished for helping
to bring in corn. It pleases him best, however,
to be going back to his old perch, so as to get
the matter dropped as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, ay, for more reasons than one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not only for the sake of Mary Kay, but
because the mischief that he wanted to set right
is over. It cannot be said now that our people
hereabouts want bread; and so the sooner all
ill-will is forgotten, the better. Hoy, oy! how
does your dame get you such a wedge of cold
meat as that? She must be a thriftier body than
mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No thrift in the world served to get me cold
meat six months ago; but times have changed
since; and, as my wife says, it is mortal hard
work I have to do here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mortal hard work,—swinging your heels,
and looking at people going to the fair! Mine is
as toilsome as yours, neighbour; and yet I have
only a lump of hard cheese with my bread, while
droves and droves of bullocks and sheep are
passing within sight to the fair, making one think
of mottled beef and juicy mutton. I wonder
when the day will come for the working man to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.112'>112</span>have his fill of meat, like him that does not
work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Chatham will tell you the very day;—whenever
this vale, and all our other vales, are
portioned out for the purposes they are most fit
for,—the choice parts for corn, and the meadows
for pasture, and the heights for sheep-walks, and
so on; instead of our insisting on growing wheat
at all costs, and so preventing our having as much
meat and cheese and butter and milk as we should
like. If we could get our corn where we please,
we should soon find other food growing more
plentiful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And a few things besides food. I suppose
the Leeds men would take off all the wool we
could grow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and without bating an ounce of what
they get already from abroad; for where we get
corn, there we must carry cloth, among other
things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then we must get more houses run up
for our new weavers. By the way, if our landlords
let more land to be built upon, that would
fully make up for any difference from the fields
being turned back into sheep-walks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And with a much better chance of the rents
being paid regularly for ten years together;—which
is no small consideration to such men as
Fergusson just now. There’s Chatham walking
away without speaking to one of us. Call him;
your voice is loudest. Well done! You make
the very cows turn and low at us. He won’t
come. How he points towards his work, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.113'>113</span>much as to tell us we ought to be going to ours!
All in good time, friend Chatham. We have not
been shut up for months, with our hands before
us, like you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor yet been much busier than he, for that
matter. ’Tis a pity this fair did not fall on our
idle time. There go the folks in a train, while
we are dawdling here——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then don’t let us dawdle. Off with you,
children! We are going to lop the branches,
and you may chance to get an ugly cut if you
don’t keep clear of the hatchet. Come, neighbour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In a minute, neighbour. Bless us! look at
that monkey, down in the road! How the
creature dances, like any Christian! And the
music sounds prettily, does not it? I am just
like a child for wanting to be off to the fair.
Who is that rogue of a boy plaguing the beast?
I think it is John Kay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not it. John is in your predicament,—can’t
go to the fair till night. It does seem
hard to keep so young a lad sweating among
those furnaces all the week, and on a holyday
especially; but he is proud of being on full work,
like a man, and left with the few in charge of the
furnaces; and they say his parents have comfort
of him, in respect of his carrying home his
wages.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is very well; for they want all they can
get, while that poor woman goes on pining as
she does. She has got very feeble lately.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And well she may, taking nothing stronger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.114'>114</span>than tea, after having lived so differently. She
made the change suddenly too. ’Tis not six
weeks since I saw her as bad as she ever was,—trying
to reach home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay; after striving and striving all the
winter to get the better of it, poor soul! But
that falling back seemed to be the finishing of
her. She has never held up her head since, nor
ever will, in my opinion, though she has more
reason to hold up her head than for these five
years past; as they say her family are for ever
trying to make her think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor Kay finds full work and cheap food
come too late for him; for whatever fails to do
his wife good brings little comfort to him. For
all he used to do in the way of light words and
silly fun, he has made a good husband; and no
man can be more down-hearted than he is to see
his wife in this way. No: that is not his boy
John below. He would not let him be abroad
plaguing monkeys when he may be called for any
minute to see his mother die.——Bravo, boy,
whoever you be! Little John Kay could not
have done the thing more cleverly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There runs the monkey! Look ye! Through
the gap! over the slope in no time! He will be
up in the tree before they can catch him. Did
you ever see man in such a passion as his master?
I don’t wonder, having got within a mile of the
fair, and full late too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! but you missed seeing how the lad
slipped the chain the very moment the man beat
the poor animal over the nose. Trust the beast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.115'>115</span>for running away at the first hint! A fine time
it will take to get him back again!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at his red jacket, showing so unnatural
on the tree top! Down he comes again. No,
not he! it is only to get farther out on the
branch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is a marked tree that he is upon.
Suppose we cut it down next. It joins no other,
and monkey must come down with it or without
it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The harassed owner of the monkey received
this proposal as a very bright thought. The
monkey seemed to be of the same opinion, though
not so fully approving of the idea. He chattered,
screamed, whisked the skirts of his red coat, and
clapped his paws together as he saw the workmen
gathering round the tree with shouts, leaving
neglected nice bits of food which monkey would
fain have had the benefit of, and shaking their
tools at him in token of what he had shortly to
expect.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the first shock, monkey became perfectly
quiet, squatting with his fore paws clapped together,
and looking down, like an amateur observer,
on the progress of the work. In proportion
as there was any movement below, he descended
a little way, to look into the matter more
closely, and then returned to his place on the
fork of the branch. By the time it began to
totter, a new ecstacy seemed to seize the beast.
Again he mounted to the topmost bough that was
strong enough to bear his weight; and when
there, he again jabbered and screamed. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.116'>116</span>thought this was terror at his approaching downfall,
and others took it for delight at seeing the
circle divide to leave room for the tree to fall.
The master, however, believed that he saw some
object which excited him on the road, which was
hidden by the trees from less exalted spectators.</p>

<p class='c001'>The master was right. There was a crowd
gathering at a short distance, as was shortly
made known by the busy hum which came upon
the ears of those who were standing among the
trees on the slope. From end to end of England
was such a tumult of many voices heard when
the news arrived which caused the present assemblage.
The agricultural districts took it very
quietly, to be sure; but the manufacturing towns
and villages were all in a ferment throughout the
island. Meetings were convened at the moment
of the arrival of the newspapers; and while manufacturers
assembled in town halls, or addressed
the people from the balconies of inn-windows,
workmen of all classes met on the green, in the
wood, about the public house, or wherever they
could most numerously collect, for the purpose of
declaring their opinions to the government.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intelligence which caused all this bustle
related to what the House of Commons had been
doing and planning about the corn-laws—a House
of Commons which had the year before barely
managed to retain the confidence of the manufacturing
classes by throwing out the suggestion
of a Committee of its own, that the prices to
which corn must arrive at home before importation
was permitted should be very much raised.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.117'>117</span>A proposal like this, made at a time when the
home price was at least 112<i>s.</i> per quarter, showed
so determined an intention on the part of the
proposers to render their country wholly self-dependent
in the article of food, (<i>i. e.</i> to limit the
population and wealth of the country to a certain
bound, which should be agreeable to the
landowners,) that the only chance the House of
Commons had of preserving the allegiance of
the bulk of the people was by rejecting the proposal;
and the proposal had been accordingly
rejected. The watchfulness of the people had
not, however, been lulled. Their subsequent
brief enjoyment of cheap food had strengthened
their vigilance over the operations of the Commons’
House; and they were the more intent as
they knew that the landowners were suffering
cruelly from the reduction of their rents and the
deterioration of their estates; and that these landlords
would probably attribute their losses to the
late admission of foreign corn, rather than to the
true cause,—the previous system of restriction.
The event proved such vigilance to be very needful.
The late fall of prices had disclosed an
appalling prospect to the owners of land. They
found that their extraordinary methods of legislation
had exposed their country to a much more
extensive dependence on foreign supplies than
they had attempted to obviate, and that they
had been working hard to reduce their own
rents, and hurt their own estates, by the very
means they had taken to enrich themselves.
During such a remarkably fruitful season as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.118'>118</span>present (the natural follower of several bad seasons)
the supply would be so plentiful as to cause
the poorer soils to be thrown back into pasturage,
the demand meantime increasing (as it
had been for some time increasing) up to the
maximum supply; so that on the first occurrence
of a merely average season, the nation would be
more dependent on a foreign supply than it had
ever been before. Under this panic, the House
voted a series of resolutions, declaring it expedient
to let exportation alone, and to impose
very high duties on importation. The news of
the passing of these resolutions, and of the preparation
of two bills founded upon them, was that
which stirred up all England to remonstrance, and
occasioned the Yorkshire graziers to leave their
droves in the fair, and the corn-dealers to quit
their resort in the market, to hear what would be
said by the manufacturers who came forth from
their desks, the artificers who poured in from the
enjoyment of their holyday, and the country labourers
who dropped down from among the hills,
or converged to the point of meeting from the
wide-spreading fields.</p>

<p class='c001'>The day being warm and the road dusty, it
was natural that the sounds of the wood-cutters’
labour should suggest to the gathering crowd the
idea of meeting on the grass, in the outskirts of
Fergusson’s wood. Mr. Fergusson and his sons
were found in the fair, and they gave permission,
and promised to come presently and hear what
was going on. Chatham was met on the road,
just about to turn up towards the quarry; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.119'>119</span>he was easily persuaded to go back and help;
and the whole party was approaching when
Monkey offered them his uncouth welcome from
the top of the tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tree was left slanting to its fall when the
people began to pour in from the road, and to
possess themselves of the trunks which lay about,
in order to pile them into a sort of hustings. The
organ-man could find no one to assist him in
catching his monkey, in case the rogue should
vouchsafe to descend from his high place. Nobody
could attend to the monkey now; and if he
chose to run off from one side of the tree while his
master was at the other, and lead the chase as
far as Sheffield, he might, for any thing the
woodmen seemed to care. Flinging down their
tools, or resting them against their shoulders,
they threw themselves along on the carpet of wild
anemones which stretched beneath the trees;
while the more restless mechanics flitted about
among the stems, looking, with their smutted
faces and leathern aprons, very unnatural inhabitants
of such a place. Long after Chatham and
others began to enlarge upon the matter which
had brought them together, the frowning brows
and eager gesticulations of these men, as they
talked low with one another, showed that they had
their own thoughts, and were not met merely to
have notions put into their heads.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it possible to mistake what these men are
thinking and feeling?” asked Chatham of Mr.
Fergusson. “If the House of Commons could for
once take their sitting here, with the Speaker on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.120'>120</span>yon bit of grey rock, and the members on these
trunks or on the flowery ground, like the Indians
when they hold a council, they would legislate
for these listeners after another fashion than they
now do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why so? I see, as well as you, that these
men are thinking and feeling strongly; but are
they thinking that which should change the
policy of a nation?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That which will change the policy of a nation,
though not so soon as if the National
Council could for once come here to legislate.
Friends!” he said to some near him, whose sudden
silence called the attention of others beyond
them,—“I am telling this gentleman that I
believe there is one thought in the minds of us
all, though that thought might be spoken in many
ways. One might say, that he felt himself injured
by the high price of bread last year, and
another by the falling off of work—one might
point to the grave of his spirit-broken brother,
and another hold up before us his pining child—one
might be angry with our masters for altering
our wages, so that we never know what to
depend upon, and another may be grieved that
Anderson should have sharpened his speech, and
that Mr. Fergusson should come among us with
so grave a countenance as this; but there is one
plain thought at the bottom of all this,—that the
prime necessary of life is the last thing that
should be taxed. I should not wonder if Mr.
Fergusson himself agrees with us there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It depends upon what the object of the tax
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.121'>121</span>is,” replied Mr. Fergusson. “If the corn-tax be
laid on to swell the revenue of the state, I grant
that it is the very worst that could be imposed;
because, while it presses so heavily on all as to
cramp immeasurably the resources of the nation,
it presses most on those who have little but the
prime necessary of life, and the harder in proportion
as they possess little else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In what case will you then justify a corn-tax?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When it is laid on to balance an excess of
taxes laid on the agriculturists over those laid on
other classes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A confusion of voices here arose, in cries of—</p>

<p class='c001'>“We will take them on ourselves!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You and yours shall live duty-free, if you
give us corn free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We pay your taxes many times over already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will work one day in the week for you for
nothing but a free corn trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will give you a share of my wages every
Saturday night, and my vote, if you’ll go up to
Parliament, and speak our minds there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And many a black hand was held out to see if
Mr. Fergusson would say “Done.” He did not
quite say this, but he went on,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure I can have no objection to a
change in our system; for I have suffered as well
as you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, and you would make it up by having
corn dearer than ever,” cried one of the discontented.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I would not, because I am convinced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.122'>122</span>that this would only bring on a repetition of the
same evils some time hence, and in an aggravated
form. I dread, as much as you can do,
further fluctuations of this kind, which have injured
us all in turn. More bad seasons followed
by plenty, with a fickle legislation, and those of
you who have pined will die; the masters who
have ceased to be rich will be ruined; the farmers
who have now buried some of their capital will
find that they have got back a part only to
lose the whole; and, as for me and mine, I
should expect the gates that are now unhinged to
be broken up for fuel, and the stones of my crumbling
fences to be used for knocking me off my
horse. If in those days I should go abroad, it
would be to rescue my life from your rage, and
not, as now, to economise the income which I
can no longer spend among you. No, no; we
must have no more mismanagement like that
which has well nigh ruined us all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What does he mean? Where is he going?
Won’t he live at the Abbey any more?” were the
questions which went round, and caught Mr. Fergusson’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I told you,” he said, “that we had all suffered
in turn, though I am far from pretending
that we have suffered equally. I assure you that
I spend many an anxious day, and many a sleepless
night, in planning how I may fulfil all my
engagements as a member of society, and keep
my promises to my children. These engagements
were made when I was prosperous; and
now I am no longer prosperous. My steward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.123'>123</span>comes to me every quarter-day with a smaller
handful of receipts, and a longer bill of arrears;
and wherever I turn, I see with my own eyes,
and find many comforters to tell me, that my
property is wasting for want of care, and that I
must sustain great losses hereafter for want of a
small expenditure which cannot be afforded now.
If I or my tenants could just spare a hundred
pounds here, and fifty there, and two hundred
somewhere else, it would save me a thousand or
two that will have to be spent at last. But it
cannot be done. My sons are entering upon a
new stage of a very expensive but necessary education;
and though my daughters have given up
their usual journey to London, I have no hundreds
to spare. My tenants cannot scrape their
rent together, and it is folly to ask them for their
fifties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The papers say you have lowered your
rents.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true that I have; and I am sorry the
papers take upon themselves to praise me for it
as for an act of generosity. You all know now
that I cannot get my full rents, so that I do not
in fact give up any thing that I might have; and
I consider it no more than justice to reduce the
claims which I made when the farmers were in
very different circumstances from those in which
they are at present placed. I have no objection
to the newspapers stating the fact, because it may
lead others to follow my example, and may
afford a useful lesson to all; but I do object to
the act being lauded as one of generosity, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.124'>124</span>much as I should to the House of Commons
being praised for giving up the bills now in question,
in case the whole nation should prove to be
of your mind about them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very fair! very good! Spoken like one
of the people!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am one of the people,—taxed as one of the
people, I assure you,” continued Mr. Fergusson.
“You offer,—very sincerely, I have no doubt,—to
take the taxes of the landowners upon yourselves,
in return for a free trade in corn. But
you know perfectly well that such an arrangement
cannot be made, even if we chose to accept
your kind offer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why not? What prevents, if we are all of
a mind?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Chatham thought that it would take so long to
bring all people into one mind on the point that
it would be a quicker and probably equally good
method to allow such a duty on imported corn as
would cover the landlords’ peculiar liabilities. A
small duty,—at the most 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> per quarter,—would
be found sufficient, he believed, at the beginning;
and such a duty as this would not materially
impede importation. Under such a system
of regular supply, pauperism would decrease,
or ought to decrease, year by year; this would
lessen the burdens of the agriculturist, and open
the way for a further reduction of the duty, which
should expire when that equalization of taxation
should take place which must arrive as nations
grow wiser.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Without committing myself as to the amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.125'>125</span>of duty,” replied Mr. Fergusson, “I may say
that I should not object to some such plan as
Chatham proposes: and I would insist that
the duty should, above all things, be fixed.
If a duty is imposed on the basis of the distresses
of the country, it may be right enough
that it should be graduated, the duty lessening as
prices rise: but in the case of such a duty as
Chatham advocates,—a mere set-off against our
excess of taxation,—it should be so far fixed as
that every one might know beforehand how it
would operate, and all classes be able to make
their calculations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, yes,” said Chatham. “If any corn-tax
is, generally speaking, bad, none can be so
bad as one that makes twice as much uncertainty
as there is occasion for. To impose a duty on the
basis, as you say, sir, of the distresses of the country,
seems an odd way of raising money for the
state; and to make such a duty a gambling matter
seems to me more odd still. In the case of such
a graduated duty as you speak of, falling as home
prices rise, the corn-dealer’s business becomes an
affair of gambling speculation. He sends for
corn when wheat is at one price, and brings it in
when wheat is at another. If the price has fallen,
he has so much more duty to pay that the speculation
may ruin him. If the price has risen, he
may make enormous profits that he did not expect.
I may say this much for the corn-dealer,
as Kirkland is not here to speak for himself, that
he had much rather pay a constant duty which
would leave him no uncertainties to manage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.126'>126</span>but the supplies of corn at home and abroad,
than take the chance of enormous occasional
profits at the risk of ruinous occasional loss.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, Chatham: there you come to a very
important part of the question,—the uncertainty
of supply. If you can answer for our having a
regular and unfailing supply of food from abroad,
when we have too little for our people at home,
you can answer for more than the House of
Commons can; for they adopt as their principle
the safety of lessening our dependence on
foreign countries for food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When they can answer for our having a regular
and constantly increasing supply at home,”
replied Chatham, “I may perhaps yield the
question to them. When you can find any member
of their committee who will tell me, at any
seed-time, what will be the produce of an average
sowing, I will consent to his making the nation
depend on that produce. When you can bring
me proof that the rich harvests of one district are
not of use in repairing the deficiencies of a less
favoured district, I will own it to be as safe to
depend for supply on our own little island as on
the collective corn districts of the globe. When
you can convince me that we buy as advantageously
by fits and starts as under a system of
regular commerce, I will grant that regularly
importing countries have not the steadiest market.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A listener observed that Kirkland had lately
said, in reference to his having had to hunt up
corn abroad during the scarcity, that there was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.127'>127</span>difference of ten per cent. between “Will you
sell?” and “Will you buy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kirkland learned that saying from a greater
man than any of us,” observed Mr. Fergusson.
“It was Franklin who said that true saying.
But there are other uncertainties to be considered,
besides the variations of the seasons.
Clouds gather over men’s tempers as well as over
the face of the sky. Tempests of passion sweep
away the fruits sown between nations in a season
of promise. Springs of kindness are dried up,
as well as fountains of waters. We have not
considered the risks of war.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed but we have, sir,” replied Chatham,
“and we come to the conclusion that when we are
at war with all the nations whom God has blessed
with his sunshine and his rain, we shall not deserve
to touch God’s bounties, and it will be
high time that we should be starved off God’s
earth. If we wanted to restrict our own trade,
sir, instead of throwing it open,—if we wanted
to forbid our merchants buying of more than one
or two countries, we might believe that war would
bring starvation; but never while our ships may
touch at all ports that look out upon the seas.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We do not grow half our own hemp,” said a
man with a coil of tow about his waist. “Has
the British navy ever wanted for ropes? If our
enemies at sea ever meant to hurt us, their readiest
way would have been to stint us in cordage;
and, since they have not done it during all this
war, it must be, I take it, because they can’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly,” replied Chatham. “In cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.128'>128</span>like these, Mr. Fergusson, our conclusions about
the choice of an evil or a danger must be compounded
of the greatness and of the degree of
probability. Now here is, under the old restrictive
system, a vast amount of certain evil, which
you and the House of Commons seem to think
little of, in comparison with a much greater evil
which it is barely within the line of possibility to
happen. Here are present labourers who have
had their spirits bowed and their bodies worn by
want, and who can look out from this green to
the spot where their kindred are laid under the
sod, mown down by this sharp law like meadow
flowers under the scythe. Here are present the
gentle who have been made fierce, the once loyal
who were made rebels,—ay, and the proudly innocent
who have been disgraced by captivity——”</p>

<p class='c001'>While Chatham stopped for breath, one and
another cried out to Mr. Fergusson,</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you think us rude in our speech to you,
sir, you may lay it to the bread-tax.” “Get the
bread-tax taken off, and you will hear no more
of the midnight drill.” “Masters and men never
would have quarrelled, sir, but for the bread-tax.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From this place, you may see,” Chatham
went on, “not only poppies coming up instead of
wheat, and stones strewed where lambs should
have been browsing, but hovels with mouldering
thatch where there should have been slated
houses, and a waste wilderness stretching beyond
where there might have been the abodes of thousands
of busy, prosperous beings; and all
through the pressure of restrictive law.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.129'>129</span>“And where there is not a waste, there will
soon be a deserted mansion,” added Mr. Fergusson.
“I told you I was going away. My sons
must finish their education abroad; and we all go
together, that we may live within our means in
a manner that we could not do at home. This
is one consequence of the late fluctuations——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can tell you, sir,” said Oliver, showing
himself from behind a knot of his own men,—“I
can tell you another consequence that would
have happened if the late fluctuation had not
taken place. If prices had not fallen, and fallen
just when they did, I must have gone abroad to
live, where I might work to some purpose,—where
my capital might have been employed in
producing wealth, instead of being given to my
workmen to buy dear food. Moreover, if prices
now rise again so as to make you change your
mind and stay, I must go; so it comes just to
the question, which of us can best be spared?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it comes to that,” replied Mr. Fergusson,
“it is clear that I can best be spared. Without
saying anything about our respective characters
and influence, it is plain that it signifies much less
where I spend my revenue, than whether you invest
your capital at home or abroad. If it must
come to this, I am the one to go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what but a bad state of the law could
have brought the matter to this point?” said
Chatham. “What greater curse need a nation
have than a legislation which condemns either
the rent-receiver or the capitalist to banishment?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.130'>130</span>Oliver’s men proceeded to agree in whispers
that he was not in earnest about going abroad;
that it was only said to make the landlord wonder,
and put the question in a strong light. A
man must suffer much and long before he would
leave his own land, and the workmen that were
used to his ways, and all that he had ever been
accustomed to.</p>

<p class='c001'>“True,” said Oliver, overhearing their remarks;
“and I have suffered much and long. It is true
that banishment is the last attempt that many a
man will make to improve his fortunes; but it is
an attempt which must and will be made, if the
fortunes of our manufacturers continue to decline.
I know all that you can tell me about the hardship
to the workmen who are left behind to be
soon driven into the workhouse. I feel how I
should grieve to turn you all off, and shut up my
foundry; but it is one of the natural consequences
of a legislation like that which we have lived
under. If our manufactures remain unsold on
account of the cost of feeding the labourers, it is
certain that the manufacturers will carry their capital,—the
subsistence-fund of the people,—to
some cheaper land.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And how much was it supposed that the price
of wheat would fall if the ports were opened?
was the question proposed by the workmen, in
their alarm at the idea of manufacturing capital
being forced out of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Six, seven, eight, or, at most, nine shillings,
was the utmost fall, on the average of the last ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.131'>131</span>years, anticipated by Chatham, Oliver, and Fergusson,—a
fall which, accompanied as it would be
with regularity of supply, and freedom from panic
and from the intolerable sense of oppression,
would prove an all-important relief to the manufacturer
and artisan, without doing the landlord
and farmer any injury. Such a fall as this would
drive out of cultivation none but the poorest soils,
which ought never to have passed under the
plough; there would be an end of the farmer’s
sufferings from vicissitude; and the small reduction
of the landlords’ rents would be much more
than compensated by the advantages which must
accrue to them from the growth of a thriving
population within their borders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chatham observed that many might object to
the estimate just given of the probable fall of
price on opening the ports,—and it was indeed a
matter which required large observation and close
calculation; but he, for one, was not disposed to
rest the question on probabilities of this nature,
but rather on the dilemma,—“If the price of
corn is heightened by a restrictive system, why
should the nation be taxed for the sake of the
landlords? if not,—why do the landlords fear
a free trade in corn?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is yet another consideration,” observed
Mr. Fergusson, “and a very important one, Chatham.
You have said nothing of Ireland, while
the fact is that Ireland sends us three times as
much corn as she sent us ten years ago. There
seems no reason why so fertile a country should
not supply us with more and more till our prices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.132'>132</span>fall the nine shillings per quarter we were talking,
and even till we are able to export. What
do you say to this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That it is owing to the establishment of a free
trade in corn between us and Ireland that we employ
so much more than formerly of her industry,
and enjoy so much more of its fruits. What
has been proved so great a good in the experiment
with one country, is the finest possible encouragement
to extend the system to all. If you object,
as I see you are ready to do, that this success
with respect to Ireland renders a further emancipation
of the trade unnecessary, I answer, that
the corn-laws are by the same rule unnecessary,—an
unnecessary mockery and irritation of the
people. If they are not yet unnecessary because
Ireland does not yet fully supply us,—in exact
proportion as they are not unnecessary, they are
hurtful. From this dilemma, Mr. Fergusson, you
cannot escape, and you had best help us to press
it upon the House of Commons. If you will
join us, sir, in drawing up our address to Parliament
on the principles we have been arguing
about for this hour past, I rather think we ourselves
may find, and may help to show the House,
that landowners and their neighbours have the
same interests, and are willing to be all happy together,
if the legislature will let them. Whenever
we see a wealthy and wise landowner taking up
the question on its broad principles, and addressing
the legislature, whether from his seat in the
Lords or by petition to the Commons, as a citizen
rather than as one of a protected class, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.133'>133</span>shall feel a joyful confidence that these broad
principles will soon be recognized and acted upon
by the loftiest members of the state.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is time,” replied a voice from below, “for
they have long been forced upon the lowliest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is one of the deep things that is better
understood by many an one that has never learned
his letters than by some who are boasted of for
their scholarship,” observed another. “Wakeful
nights and days of hardship drive some
truths deep and firm into the minds of the veriest
fool, which the wise man, in his luxury, finds it
difficult to learn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You say truly enough that it is time,” said
a third, with sternness in his look and tone.
“The charity comes too late which sticks bread
between the teeth of a famished man; and the
justice we seek will be a mockery if it does not
come in time to prevent another such season of
misery as we have endured, and as they threaten
us with again. Yet they talk of playing the
same game over again. Come, Chatham, make
haste down, and draw up what we are to say, and
let us sign before the sun goes down. We have
not an hour to lose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not an hour to lose, as you say, neighbour,
when for many it is already too late. Mend the
system as fast as you will, there is many and
many a home where there will never be comfort
more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Several who were present knew that Chatham
must be thinking of Kay’s family when he said
these words. He went on,</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.134'>134</span>“You might as well hope to close up the
clefts of yonder ash, and to make it rich with
growing grafts, struck as it was by last year’s
lightning, as to heal the spirit of a man whose
fortunes have been blighted by the curse of partial
laws, and to repair his wrongs. For him it
is too late. He stands the monument of social
tyranny till his last hour of decay. For him it
is too late; but not yet for others. There are
thousands yet in infancy,—millions yet to be
born whose lot depends on what is done with the
corn-laws in our day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mine and that of my descendants does,” observed
Oliver; “though, in one sense, it is also
too late for me. I have lost my place in the
market abroad; and for this my work-people are
suffering and will suffer. But let no chance of
recovery be lost through our delay. Come, Chatham;
let us be gone, and give the people the
opportunity of declaring their wishes before they
disperse, and fancy that, because dispersed, they
have no power. Let every man raise his voice
so that the legislature may understand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All present were so eager to do this that no
leisure seemed to be left for the follies which
usually lurk in some corners of all popular assemblies,
from the largest to the smallest. No
monkey tricks were played by any but the monkey,
though country clowns and many boys were
present. When the animal, after being well nigh
given up in despair by his irritated master, made
a sudden descent on the head and shoulders of
a listener, he was very quietly delivered over to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.135'>135</span>owner to receive the chastisement which was prepared
for him, and which no one troubled himself
to turn round to witness. All were too busy
watching Chatham writing with a pencil, and on
paper furnished by Mr. Fergusson, who sat beside
him on his woodland seat, now agreeing,
now dissenting, but in no case desiring to hinder
the full execution of the object for which his
neighbours were assembled.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a short petition to the Commons’ House
against the imposition of further restrictions on
the foreign corn-trade had been drawn up, and
fully agreed to by a large majority, it was carried
away with all expedition to be copied and signed
while the fair was yet thronged; and the wood
was found by the noonday sun nearly as quiet as
when visited by the midnight moon;—as nearly
so as the blackbird and the linnet would permit.</p>

<h3 id='ch1.7' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span><br> <br> THE BREAKING UP.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Kay was indeed one of the many to whom a temporary
relief from the bread-tax came too late.
Five years before, no man could be found more
eager in the statement of his case of hardship:
five months before, he had still some hope that a
perpetuation of the then ample supply of food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.136'>136</span>might yet avail to restore his domestic peace.
His wife might struggle through her difficulties,
and be once more a mother to his children, and in
aspect and mind something like the woman he
married. Now, however, all hope of this was
over, and Kay had had no heart to attend the
meeting in the wood, or to mix with his former
companions more than could not be avoided.
He went straight from the foundry to the side of
his wife’s chair, as long as she was able to sit up,
and to nurse her when she at length took to her
bed. He owed her the exemplary attention
she received from him; for the same poverty
which had seduced her into a fatal habit had
embittered his temper, and they had need of
mutual forgiveness. Since the noble effort each
had made,—he to warn his children against her
example, and she to break away from the indulgence
which had become necessary,—neither
had sinned against the other. No rough word
was heard from his lips, and self-denial, by
Mary’s help, never failed. Mrs. Kay sank slowly
and very painfully. She well knew that she must
sink, either way, and to this she had no objection;
but often and often, in the solitude of her daily
sufferings and the restlessness of her nightly
dozings, she thought that every body was hard
upon her; that they might have let her sink a
little more rapidly, and give her what she longed
for. They did not seem to feel for her as she
thought they might, or they would indulge her
without letting the children perceive it. Mary must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.137'>137</span>know sometimes, when she saw her very low, what
it must be that she wanted; but instead of taking
any notice, she only began to talk about any thing
that would win away her mind for a while.
Then all these secret complainings were thrust
away as if they were suggestions of the devil,
and a throng of reproachful recollections would
come,—of her husband’s patience in smoothing
her pillow twenty times in a night, and holding
her head for hours when her startings had
frightened her; and of Mary’s never seeming
tired, with all that was upon her, or saying a
word about what she gave up for her in keeping
Chatham waiting so long. She knew that it was
only on her account that they were not married
yet, and she hoped she should soon be under the
sod, and no hinderance to any body; meanwhile,
nobody but she would perceive, so much as
Mary had to say now, and so cheerfully as she
spoke, that she was giving up any thing for a
sister who had deserved so little from her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Kay expressed all this so fully and forcibly
to her husband one day, that he told Mary he
really believed it would make all parties happier
if she would marry Chatham at once. The
affair was soon settled, and every body concerned
was so evidently satisfied, that very few neighbours
ventured to pronounce above their breath how
shocking it was to marry from a house where
there must soon be a death.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Skipper, who had throughout been profuse
of neighbourly attentions, came to sit with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.138'>138</span>Mrs. Kay while the party were gone to church
on the Sunday morning when the marriage took
place. She was far from being the most considerate
and judicious of nurses; but Mrs. Kay
did not seem so alive to this as her husband and
Mary, and appeared to like that she should
occasionally supply their place. This morning
she showed herself with eyes more red and
swollen than a nurse should ever exhibit. Mrs.
Kay directly perceived this.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O dear, Mrs. Skipper, what has happened to
you? I am sure some misfortune has happened.
Tell me! Tell us at once.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, love, ’tis no misfortune of mine particularly,
but every body’s misfortune.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, that is worse still! Nothing has come
in the way of the wedding?” And she tried to
start up in her bed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bless you, no! Lie still. The wedding is
likely to go on well enough; and in my opinion
it is high time they were off to church. No, no.
It is only that the Fergussons are gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gone!” cried every voice in the house.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. Just slipped away quietly on a Sunday
morning, when nobody was suspecting, that they
might not have their hearts half broke, I suppose——-“—A
loud sob stopped the good woman’s
utterance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I am sure, Mrs. Skipper, it gives us
all much concern,” said Kay. “They are good
people,—the Fergussons,—and of great consequence
to all the people about them; and it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.139'>139</span><a id='corr139.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title=' e'>be</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_139.1'><ins class='correction'>be</ins></a></span> a sad thing to see the Abbey shut up, and the
grounds left to themselves. It is not the less
melancholy for our having looked forward to it
this long while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why no, but rather the more,” said Chatham,
“because we know what misfortune sent them
away. When the wind has torn the linnets’
nest, we know that they will fly away; and the
wood will miss them the more, and not the less,
for the fear that they will not venture to build in
the same place again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And ’tis six years, come Michaelmas,” said
Mrs. Skipper, “that they have had hot bread
from me every morning, except while they were
just gone to London. They have been the best
customers that ever I had, and now there is no
knowing——They looked very grave, every
one of them that I could see, as they whisked
past. I wonder whether they saw how I cried.
I hope they did. I am sure I don’t care who
saw, for I am not ashamed of being sorry for
such as they.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought they would have stayed till harvest,”
said Mary. “Such a beautiful harvest as it will
be this year. I have been telling my sister,
Mrs. Skipper, what a fine promising season it is.
John and I shall manage a better gleaning this
year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, yes, Mrs. Kay,” observed the widow,
“I could not help thinking, when I saw the sun
shining, and the fields waving, and the people
all abroad in their best, that it is hard upon you
to be lying here, so dull, when you have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.140'>140</span>seen a green field, nor a number of people, for I
don’t know when. Well, I must tell you all
about it, instead, when they are gone. Now,
Mary, what are you going in that way for, as
grave as a quaker, and more so than the quaker
I saw married once? I know you have a gown
more fit to be married in than that. Go and put
it on in a minute,—your light green one, I mean,
and I will lend you my pink handkerchief. I
will step for it, and bring it before you have got
your gown on. And you shall have this cap,—the
ribbon is pink, you see; and my other better
one will do just as well for me. Come! Make
haste!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was not Mary’s will, however; and as
her brother declared it quite time to be gone, she
proceeded at once to the altar in her dark-coloured
gown, thus leaving a fruitful topic for Mrs. Skipper
to enlarge upon to her patient, as soon as the
party had closed the door behind them. Before
they went out, Mary offered a smiling hint to the
widow not to cry any more about the Fergussons,
or any thing else, if she could help it, while they
were away; and to keep her charge as cheerful,
if she could, as she had been for the last few
hours; hours of more ease than she had known
for some time past.</p>

<p class='c001'>On their return, they found Mrs. Skipper,—not
crying,—but in great trouble,—in far too
deep a trouble for tears. She was leaning over
the bed, looking aghast, when Chatham and
Mary entered, arm in arm, with Kay and his two
elder children following.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.141'>141</span>“Why, Mrs. Skipper, what have you been
doing to my wife?” cried Kay, seeing that the
sick woman’s eyes were fixed, and her whole
countenance quite different from what he had ever
seen it before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing, Mr. Kay; but I thought you never
would have come back. She took such a strange
way the minute you were gone, I had the greatest
mind to call you back.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish you had,” said Mary, who had already
thrown off her bonnet, and was chafing the cold
hands that lay helpless on the bed clothes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! she has changed much within a few
minutes too. Her hand lies still now; but I
had to put it down several times. She kept
stretching it out as if she thought to reach something;
and I supposed she was thirsty, but——”</p>

<p class='c001'>A mournful shake of the head from Kay
stopped her. He said she had often done this
when she was not quite herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes: often and often,” said Mary; “and
I have seen her as bad as this before. Look,
she is coming about. She sees us now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If she be not trying to speak!” whispered
Mrs. Skipper.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Kay spoke, but she was wandering.
She told Mary that next Sunday should be the
day for Chatham and her to be married, as she
herself should be buried out of their way by that
time. Then perceiving Chatham, she tried to
give him some advice incoherently, and far too
painfully to be ever referred to after that day by
any of them, about not letting his wife come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.142'>142</span>poverty,—extreme poverty; and about distrusting
her in such a case, if she were an angel from
heaven.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For God’s sake stop her!” cried Kay, taking
a sudden turn through the room; and Mary
stopped her by a kiss, though her own tears were
dropping like rain. Mrs. Kay proceeded with her
self-accusations, however, as long as she could
speak at all; and the awe-struck children were
taken out of the room by Chatham.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no!” said Mary, whispering her emphatic
contradictions into the ear of the dying woman,
as soon as she could command her voice.
“You have done the noblest——you have gone
through the hardest trial——God will not
forget your struggles as you forget them yourself.
Your children shall never forget them. Well,
well. It was suffering,—it was hunger that did
all that! Don’t dwell upon that! All that was
over long ago; and now the pain is over,—just
over; and we know what the promises are. If
<em>we</em> deserved them as well——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bless you! Bless you, Mary!” cried the
husband, in a broken voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the painful impression of his wife’s words
remained as strong as ever when the restless eyes
were finally closed, and a faint smile rested on
the lips whence the breath had departed. John
was terrified by his father’s manner of fetching
him into the room, and saying, as he showed
him the corpse.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You heard her say that she had been wicked.
You heard her say——but never mind all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.143'>143</span>that. You will not know for this many a year
how noble a woman your mother was, and what
she did for your sake. And if I ever hear you
say a word,——if I see you give the least
look against her——”</p>

<p class='c001'>John slunk away as Mary took her brother’s
arm, and led him beside Chatham, while she hung
up a curtain before the bed, and made Mrs.
Skipper somewhat ashamed of being so much
less able to exert herself than the nearer connexions
of the dead. The widow presently
slipped out to consult with her neighbours on the
necessary arrangements, and to express the most
vehement admiration for the departed, while
preserving the strictest honour respecting the
particulars of the closing scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since that day, the curse of the bread-tax has
alighted again and again on that busy vale.
Again has the landowner had the painful choice
of sinking from his rank at home or going abroad
to preserve it. Again has the farmer found
himself, now marvellously rich, and now unaccountably
poor. Again has the manufacturer
repined at having to surrender his resources to
support the burden of factitious pauperism,—to
take too low a place in the markets abroad in
order that his agricultural neighbour may be
upheld in too high an one at home. Again has
the corn-dealer staked his all upon the chances
of man’s caprice, with about as much confidence
as he would upon the cast of the die. Again
gloom has brooded over the dwellings of the poor,
and evil passions have wrought there, in proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.144'>144</span>to the pressure of want,—the main spring
of the vast machinery of moral evil by which
society is harrowed and torn. And as often as
a gleam of hope and present plenty has visited
the cottage of a long-suffering artizan, it has
been clouded by the repinings of some neighbour
whose adversity has been, by ingenious methods
of misrule, made coincident with his prosperity.
In this busy vale, as in every valley of England
inhabited by thinking men, there is one question
still for ever rising through the night air, and
borne on the morning breeze,—“How long?”—and
on many a hill there are thinking men to take
up the inquiry, and echo “<span class='sc'>How long?</span>”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1.145'>145</span>
  <h3 class='c020'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>As exchangeable value is ultimately determined
by the cost of production, and as there is an
incessant tendency to an increase in the cost of
producing food, (inferior soils being taken into
cultivation as population increases,) there is a
perpetual tendency in the exchangeable value of
food to rise, however this tendency may be temporarily
checked by accidents of seasons, and
by improvements in agricultural arts.</p>

<p class='c001'>As wages rise (without advantage to the labourer)
in consequence of a rise in the value of
food, capitalists must either sell their productions
dearer than is necessary where food is cheaper,
or submit to a diminution of their profits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the first alternative, the capitalist is
incapacitated for competition with the capitalists
of countries where food is cheaper: under the
second, the capital of the country tends, through
perpetual diminution, to extinction.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the case of a thickly-peopled country
depending for food wholly on its own resources.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are many countries in the world where
these tendencies have not yet shown themselves;
where there is so much fertile land, that the cost
of producing food does not yet increase; and
where corn superabounds, or would do so, if
there was inducement to grow it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such inducement exists in the liberty to exchange
the corn with which a thinly-peopled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.146'>146</span>country may abound, for the productions in which
it is deficient, and with which a populous country
may abound. While, by this exchange, the first
country obtains more corn in return for its other
productions, and the second more of other productions
in return for its corn, than could be extracted
at home, both are benefited. The capital
of the thickly-peopled country will perpetually
grow; the thinly-peopled country will become
populous; and the only necessary limit of the
prosperity of all will be the limit to the fertility
of the world.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c001'>But the waste of capital caused by raising corn
dear and in limited quantity at home, when it
might be purchased cheap and in unlimited quantity
abroad, is not the only evil attending a restriction
of any country to its own resources of
food; a further waste of capital and infliction of
hardship are occasioned by other consequences
of such restriction.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the demand for bread varies little within
any one season, or few seasons, while the supply
is perpetually varying, the exchangeable value of
corn fluctuates more than that of any article
whose return to the cost of production is more
calculable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Its necessity to existence causes a panic to
arise on the smallest deficiency of supply, enhancing
its price in undue proportion; and as
the demand cannot materially increase on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.147'>147</span>immediate occasion of a surplus, and as corn is
a perishable article, the price falls in an undue
proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>These excessive fluctuations, alternately wasting
the resources of the consumers and the producers
of corn, are avoided where there is liberty
to the one class to buy abroad in deficient seasons,
and to the other to sell abroad in times of
superabundance.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not enough that such purchase and sale
are permitted by special legislation when occasion
arises, as there can be no certainty of obtaining
a sufficient supply, on reasonable terms,
in answer to a capricious and urgent demand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Permanently importing countries are thus
more regularly and cheaply supplied than those
which occasionally import and occasionally export;
but these last are, if their corn exchanges
be left free, immeasurably more prosperous than
one which is placed at the mercy of man and
circumstance by a system of alternate restriction
and freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>By a regular importation of corn, the proper
check is provided against capital being wasted
on inferior soils; and this capital is directed towards
manufactures, which bring in a larger return
of food from abroad than could have been
yielded by those inferior soils. Labour is at the
same time directed into the most profitable channels.
Any degree of restriction on this natural
direction of labour and capital is ultimately injurious
to every class of the community,—to landowners,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.148'>148</span>farming and manufacturing capitalists,
and labourers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Labourers suffer by whatever makes the prime
necessary of life dear and uncertain in its supply,
and by whatever impairs the resources of their
employers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Manufacturing capitalists suffer by whatever
tends needlessly to check the reciprocal growth
of capital and population, to raise wages, and
disable them for competition abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farming capitalists suffer by whatever exposes
their fortunes to unnecessary vicissitude, and
tempts them to an application of capital which
can be rendered profitable only by the maintenance
of a system which injures their customers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Landowners suffer by whatever renders their
revenues fluctuating, and impairs the prosperity
of their tenants, and of the society at large on
which the security of their property depends.</p>

<p class='c001'>As it is the interest of all classes that the
supply of food should be regular and cheap, and
as regularity and cheapness are best secured by
a free trade in corn, it is the interest of all classes
that there should be a free trade in corn.</p>

<h3 id='ch2.1' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br> <br>THE SILENT TRIP.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The brief twilight of the tropics had just sped
away before the shadows of night over the seas
which gird Ceylon, when a raft, stealing along
the quiet expanse before the breath of the night-wind,
approached the spot beneath which lay
one of the chank beds that enrich the northwest
coast of the island. The situation of the
bed was marked by the constant presence of
a boat, placed there by the lessees of the chank
bed to guard its treasures from pilferers. These
chanks, or conch-shells, are a very tempting
object of theft to the natives, not only as ornaments
for their own persons, but as being in
constant demand for the same purpose, and for
burial with the distinguished dead, throughout
the whole neighbouring continent of India.
Sawn into rings, they deck the wrists, ancles,
and fingers of many thousand dark beauties
who care as little whether they are obtained by
filching or by lawful fishing, as some fairer
belles inquire whether their articles of luxury
are smuggled or legally imported. Great precautions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.02'>02</span>are therefore necessary to preserve the
property of the chank monopolists; and the
best of these precautions are often useless. In
the present case, the guard-boat might as well
have been empty, for any opposition that it
offered to the approach of the raft. The guard
were probably asleep, or they would have perceived
it at the moment that the moon lifted her
horn above the eastern wave, spreading a sheet
of light over the still expanse. At that moment,
the two dusky figures which had been
standing erect and silent beside the mast of the
raft, began to move, though not to speak.
Marana pointed to the golden light which was
just appearing, and Rayo, understanding her
sign, proceeded to lower the sail of matting,
(which might become conspicuous in the moonlight,)
and to dislodge the mast. Both figures
then lay down beside it, so that the raft might
have appeared, even to close observation, to be
no more than a piece of drifting wood, but for
the gleams sent forth from the precious stones
with which Marana’s silver hair-pins were set,
and for the ripple of Rayo’s paddle, which he
contrived to ply as he lay. The critical moment
must be when he plunged, as there were no sea
sounds amidst which the splash might be lost.
All was as quiet as a lake. The guard-boat was
no cradle to those who slept within it, for it kept
its place as if it had been fixed in the sand of the
beach. The black points of rock which rose
above the surface at a distance towards the land
were reflected with perfect fidelity, instead of in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.03'>03</span>fluctuating lines of shadow. Marana dreaded
the plunge for her lover, and fearfully watched
to see dark figures rise up in the guard-boat
while the circles were yet spreading, and breaking
the moonlight to shivers on the surface. No
foe appeared, however; and Marana was at
liberty for new fears. There were enemies in the
green depths below more formidable than any to
the right hand or the left. It was quite as probable
that a shark might take a fancy to this
locality as a diver; and a chance meeting was
little likely to end without strife. Marana drew
towards the edge of the raft as its heavings subsided,
and looked eagerly down, dreading to see
a red tinge diffuse itself in the lucid depth, and
starting at every shadow that floated through it.
She was fingering her ebony beads meanwhile,
and her lips moved as she murmured some aspirations
compounded of a catholic prayer and a
native charm. The depth was little more than
two fathoms in this place, and Rayo was soon up
again, though the minute of his submersion
seemed incalculably longer to Marana. He delivered
his pouch to her to be emptied, and rested
himself by floating till he was ready for another
descent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again and again he dived, till Marana discovered a
treasure in the pouch which destroyed
all further temptation to theft that night, and
relieved the damsel from the anxiety of watching
more descents of her lover. A shell which
opened to the right, commonly called a right-handed
chank, a shell esteemed worth its weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.04'>04</span>in gold, appeared in the heap, and it was not
worth while to run any further risk when so
rare a possession as this was obtained. Rayo’s
spirits were so raised by his good fortune that
he insisted on paddling quite round the guard-boat,
near enough to see whether there was any
one in it, while Marana looked anxiously at the
ascending moon, whose flood of light was now
veiling the stars. When she saw arms gleaming
in the boat, she thought it too rash of her
lover to come between the sleeping guard and
the moon, and looked imploringly at him while
she pointed to the shore. His curiosity once
satisfied, the danger was soon over. Rayo ventured
to stand up to paddle, when the raft had
distanced the boat by half a mile, and Marana
began her inquiries as to what he had seen in
the deep.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo made light, as he had done for some
time past, of the achievement of diving for
chanks. He had practised it as a preparation
for becoming a pearl-fisher in waters three
times as deep, and for a much more precious
treasure. He was to make his first trial of the
nobler occupation at the approaching pearl
fishery; and he spoke with becoming indifference
of all meaner accomplishments. He
had seen no sharks to-night; there would be
more chance of them in deeper water. He had
been startled by no strange appearances: nine
fathoms down was the scene for wonders. He
had found no difficulty in filling his pouch: the
oyster beds would afford harder work. Marana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.05'>05</span>thought all this was counterbalanced by the
absence of a charmer who might say “avaunt!”
to sharks, and interpret all marvels, and lighten
all toils. If her father could have been on the
raft with them to-night, she should think as
little of the trip as Rayo himself; and if he
could but get himself engaged for the same
boat that was to carry Rayo out to his first
pearl fishing, she should have confidence in his
prosperity and safe return.</p>

<p class='c001'>They fell in with no other vessel till they
came in sight of the shore,—the wildest and
dreariest part of the shores of Ceylon. A flat
yellow beach stretched away on either hand,
without rock or tree, or any object which could
cast a shadow, except the huts of mud and
rushes which afforded a shelter to the natives.
In no place was it easier to make a landing,
and in none was it more difficult to land unperceived,
when sun or moon was above the horizon.
No jutting rocks were there, behind
whose screen a raft might lie concealed: no
shady creek into which a skiff might glide and
secrete itself beneath the mangroves: no groves
of cocoa-nut, feathering the margin of the tide,
beneath whose canopy dusky pilferers might
creep to divide their spoils. All was here open
to the sky, and to a sky whose lesser lights
leave little unrevealed even on the night of a
new moon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo and Marana had little chance of stealing
to their homes unobserved while so many
eyes were looking upon them from above, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.06'>06</span>while a certain pair of vigilant human eyes
preserved their wont of looking abroad upon
the night. The tall figure of Father Anthony,
the priest, was moving on the beach, preceded
by his still taller shadow, when the raft floated
on shore. Rayo saw this while still afloat; and
if he had been an English smuggler, he would
have pushed off again before he was recognized,
and have kept out of sight till Father Anthony
was safely housed. But Rayo’s ideas of good
manners would not allow of this. He had no
notion of failing to pay his respects to any who
came in his way, whatever might be the consequence
of the meeting; and he now greeted
Father Anthony with as much deference as
Marana herself, hoping that it was no evil
which kept their friend awake at this hour.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No worse evil than being unable to rest so
well here as in Europe, where there are no excessive
heats of the day to make us restless at
night. But what fish do you seek so late? I
fear you have lost your nets,” he continued,
seeing no fishing apparatus on board the raft.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana looked at Rayo, and Rayo said nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Chanks!” exclaimed Father Anthony, perceiving
now of what Marana’s burden consisted.
“These chanks cannot be yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“His hands brought them up,” declared
Marana, pointing to her lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It may be so, but they are no more his than
the comb in his hair would be mine if I were to
take it from him. Rayo, why did you steal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.07'>07</span>these chanks? Do not you know that God
punishes theft?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it theft to get chanks for my bride, when
I have worked long for them, and can get no
chanks by working? I thought God laid the
chanks in our seas for our brides.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They have become the property of some
who may let your brides, or the brides of India
have them, as they may see fit. God gave
them into the hands of those who possess them;
and He will be angry with any who take them
away by fraud or violence. All cannot have
these chank-beds, and those who have bought
them must be protected in their possession.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have earned as many as I have taken,”
replied Rayo; “and to-night God has given
them to me. The guard did not even stir when
I plunged.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And God gave him this,” added Marana,
showing the precious shell as an indubitable
proof of all being right. Father Anthony had
not been long enough in his present station
to know the full value of what he now took
into his hand; but if he had, his decision would
have been the same,—that the chanks were not
Rayo’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo was much in want of his friend’s guidance.
In the school, it was taught as a duty
that a just reward should be given for toil.
Was it a duty out of school to toil without reward?</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly not, except in the case of the mutual
services which friends and neighbours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.08'>08</span>should yield to each other. But nobody
thought of toiling without reward, as far as
Father Anthony knew. The chank-fishers, he
was sure, were paid. Rayo acknowledged
having received certain portions of rice, and of
cotton for clothing; but never any wages which
would purchase what was necessary for Marana
before her father would allow her to marry.
Rayo had no objection to work, but he had not
doubted about the liberty of paying himself, in
case of an insufficiency of wages. When he
heard, however, all the denunciations that Father
Anthony had to bring against the sin of theft,
and it was pressed upon him that he had actually
been guilty of the crime, he was perfectly
submissive; no less so than Marana, though
his eyes did not stream like hers, and he did
not so instantly betake himself to his devotions.
He stood with his eyes cast down, waiting for
instructions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your duty is clear, Rayo,” said Father Anthony.
“He that hath stolen must not only
steal no more, but must restore what he hath
stolen. When the sun rises, you must go to
the owners of these chanks and restore them,
relating your offence and seeking their pardon;—I
need not say humbly, for I have never
observed you fail in humility.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo made obeisance, and Marana hoped he
might also relate how he fell into the offence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he does it without any pretence of justifying
himself,” said Father Anthony, who was
not unwilling that the facts of the oppression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.09'>09</span>under which his poor friends laboured should be
brought home, on every possible occasion, to the
owners of the wealth which surrounded them,
and which they might not appropriate, “Rayo
may say why he wishes for chanks and for the
money that chanks will bring; but he must not
defend himself for having taken them without
leave. Neither must you excuse yourself before
God, Rayo; but seek His pardon before you
sleep. May He pardon and bless you, Rayo!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How far will you have to carry them?”
asked Marana, as soon as Father Anthony was
out of hearing. <a id='corr9.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='If'>“If</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_9.13'><ins class='correction'>“If</ins></a></span> it is not too far for a
woman, I will go with you, and carry them, and
confess for you. How far must they be carried.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo pointed to his father’s hut,—his own
abode, and began walking towards it with a
countenance of perfect content. But Marana
stopped, and looked the entreaty which she
dared not speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are heavy,” observed Rayo, taking the
chanks from her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no. I will carry them to the mountains,—I
will swim with them through the sea,
sooner than that the curse shall light upon you,
Rayo. Father Anthony says the curse comes
upon those who do not do as they say, and a
great curse upon those who steal as we have
done, unless they restore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will bring a curse to say what he bids
me say to the rich men. I shall fish no more
chanks, and lose what I have got, and perhaps
fish no pearls. This will be a curse.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.10'>10</span>“But what will Father Anthony say to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us see if he finds it out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the curse will come, whether Father
Anthony knows or not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your father shall charm it away, and you
shall have your rings; and the rest shall be sold
at the fishery. Then we will build a house, and
we will each have new clothing, and we will be
married.—But let us hide the chanks. If my
father finds them, he will sell some. If Neyna
finds them, she will ask for rings too. We will
hide them in the rushes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana dared not resist, but her horror of
the curse grew every moment. She did not
think at all the worse of her lover for his determination.
She rather admired the bravery of it,
her thoughts being employed, not on the sin,
but on its apprehended consequences. She
doubted whether her father had a charm strong
enough to obviate the effects of her lover’s
rashness; and she was far less afraid of anything
that might come out of the rushes than
of what might come out of the deed which
Rayo went to do there.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the torches were lighted, without which
it is unsafe to penetrate the places where leopards
may be crouching on dry sand, hidden by the
silky rushes, she went first, fearing, not the
glaring eye of a savage beast, but the vigilant
glance of some saint or demon whom her religion
or the old superstitions of the country
taught her to regard as the dispenser of punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.11'>11</span>from above. She started as the night-wind
swept among the reeds, not so much from
dread of some velvet paw that might be stealing
towards her, as from expectation of some token
of wrath. All was quiet, however. The curse
was not perceived immediately to light, and the
lovers parted in safety at the door of her father’s
hut.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana stood for some time hesitating between
lying down at once on her mat to sleep,
and waking her father, to trouble him for a charm
without loss of time. A better plan than either
flashed across her mind, and found more and
more favour the longer she entertained it. It
might avert the curse without exposing Rayo to
shame; and the loss of the chanks (which was
involved in her scheme) was a small price to pay
for such security. She hoped Rayo might be
brought to think so; and if not, she could rather
bear his anger than see the curse light upon
him. The chanks were intended chiefly for
her; and she could do without them for ornaments,
and had rather marry Rayo without a
house and without new clothing, than expose
him to the curse: and thus, by a process of
reasoning over which the fear of a curse presided,
she convinced herself that the best thing
she could do was to restore the chanks to their
oozy bed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without a torch, for she had not now the
means of getting one, she stole out, and crept to
the hiding place among the rushes. Without
bite from snake, or alarm from any living thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.12'>12</span>more formidable than a bat, she made her way
out again. Without help or hinderance, she
pushed the little raft into the water, hoisted its
mast and mat, and stood out alone into the
shining sea. What kind of malignant beings
she could imagine to be hovering between the
glorious constellations and their earthly mirror,
it was for her to tell. The miseries which she
believed them commissioned to dispense came
from a much nearer place than the nearest of
those radiant spheres, or even of the dense
clouds which began to show like a low wall
along the horizon. The miseries under the
pressure of which her lover had committed
crime, and she was now dreading the atonement,
came from the corrupt desires and infirm
judgments of men near at hand, whose passion
was for the possession of the powers of the
earth, and not for alliance with the powers of
the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Rayo rose in the morning at his father’s
call, to trim the boat for a fishing expedition, he
was surprised to see no sign of his little raft on
the beach. It might have been washed away,—the
sea being no longer so smooth as it was a
few hours before: or some unscrupulous neighbour
might have used it for his own convenience.
It was of little consequence; a raft
being the simplest and cheapest of all contrivances
by which a Cingalese can set himself
afloat.—The disappearance was explained when
old Gomgode’s flat-bottomed fishing-boat, containing
himself and Rayo, had made some progress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.13'>13</span>from the land, and was pitching in the
rising swell, while the young man threw out his
nets.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rayo, Rayo,” said Gomgode, “what is
floating out beyond? Rayo, Rayo, tell me
whether it is not your raft.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo believed it was, but could scarcely distinguish
it yet with sufficient certainty to claim
it. The old man’s sight might not be really
better than his son’s, but it was usually sharpened
by curiosity to a much greater degree than
that of the less vivacious Rayo. He now perceived
that there was a woman upon the raft,
and then Rayo also began to see very clearly;—and
not only to see, but to act. Gomgode
could not conceive what possessed Rayo to
draw in the nets so hastily, and quit their station,
and give up every thing for the sake of following
or meeting this raft, when to-day, of all
days, it was important to secure a good draught
of fish. They had come out early on purpose,
the auction of the oyster-banks being just about
to be held, giving a fine opportunity for the sale
of fish. One boat after another was dropping
out from the shore, and Rayo was losing all the
advantage of being out first,—was giving up all
his preparations, for the sake of making towards
the raft.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rayo, Rayo,” the old man exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father, Marana is there, dripping and
struggling.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it Marana? It is Marana. What sent
her out, Rayo? How long has she been out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.14'>14</span>Rayo? Did you know that she had your raft,
Rayo? O, Rayo, what is she going to do now,
Rayo?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana was about to do a somewhat perilous
thing. She was about to dash through a threatening
wave as a horserider bursts through a
blind hoop, trusting to light again. The sea
was now far too rough for so slight a machine
as this raft. It pitched and shivered as every
wave broke over it, and afforded so little secure
hold against the stronger swells which succeeded
each other, that Marana seemed to find
it her best way to pass through them separately.
She was seen standing with her face towards the
approaching wave, eyeing it steadily, and cleaving
her way through it so as to come out near
the very point to which the raft was descending
from its ridge. This was all very well for
awhile; but Marana was yet a great way from
shore, and it was scarcely possible but that such
a succession of plunges must exhaust her before
she could commit herself finally to the waves to
be cast upon the beach. It was contrary to her
habits also to use much exertion, and the effort
which brought her out thus alone upon the sea,—whatever
might be its motive,—could hardly
be long sustained. Rayo was full of wonder
and of fear; and his father’s remonstrances and
questions stood little chance of being attended
to till Marana was safe on board.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana herself, though by far the most deferential
person that Gomgode was wont to
meet, could scarcely bring herself to give an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.15'>15</span>answer to his inquiries till she had obtained
Rayo’s forgiveness for having, at great sacrifice
to herself, averted the curse from him. Meek
and downcast, the dusky beauty stood before
him, her half-clothed frame trembling with her
late exertions, and the salt water dripping from
her hair. One corner of her garment seemed
to be very carefully cherished by her. It contained
the precious right-handed chank. She
had not found in her heart to part with it, on
arriving at the place of deposit: and, while hesitating,
several good reasons for keeping it
occurred to her,—as is not unfrequently the case
with those who are religious after her manner,
any more than with those who are not religious
at all. It was a pity the shell should be lost,
and it was likely never to be fished up among so
many. It might be turned to a much better
purpose, if her father would make it a charm.
There could be no sin in keeping it, if it was
thus converted to a religious use instead of
being sold for a profit. Marana therefore kept
the chank, and was the better able to bear her
lover’s displeasure from the silent consciousness
that she held a treasure for him in her possession.</p>

<p class='c001'>She did not make a syllable of reply to his
lowering look and few cutting words against
herself; and when his wrath turned upon Father
Anthony, or rather upon any priest or religion
which interfered with his doings, Marana testified
only by a slight glance round her that she
was uneasy under this rashness of complaint.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.16'>16</span>The moment the boat touched the shore after
a prosperous trip, she hastened to her father’s
cottage, not waiting to observe how much more
Gomgode would ask for his fish than they were
actually worth, nor even to hear whether anything
was yet known of the quality of the
oysters which had been brought up as a sample
from the pearl banks, and on whose evidence
the auction was to proceed. She had an office
to discharge, in common with her neighbours;—to
dress and light up the road by which the
agent of the government was to approach: and
she was anxious to obtain the desired favour
from her father before she went forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Charmer, who was expecting an application,
in the course of this day, to hold his services
in readiness for the fishery, was now
absorbed in his preparations. He sat in a corner
of his hut with his documents spread before him.
Strips of the talipot-leaf, on which some consecrated
style, guided by a wise man’s hand, had
traced mysterious characters, lay before the
Charmer, and beads and images and various
sacred indescribable articles were scattered around.
He gave no heed to his child when she entered,
and his melancholy countenance wore a deeper
sadness than usual.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father!” softly said Marana, after some time
waiting his pleasure; “where will the sharks be
during the fishery?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Charmer shook his head, and acknowledged
his doubt whether St. Anthony would be
permitted to keep them all within the bounds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.17'>17</span>Adam’s Bridge, or whether some would be left
at large between the north banks and the shore.
The south banks would be safe; but the north,
alas! were those in which Marana was interested.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father! the monsoon will surely not arrive
too early?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not till April is nearly past,” he replied,
cheerfully. “It is even likely that there may
be complaints in the south of drought, from the
delay of the rains. There will be no storms in
our fishery.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will ask Father Anthony to praise the
saints.—Will the fishery be rich?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To some, and not to others. This is commonly
the case; and I cannot discover whose countenances
will be sad in Aripo, and whose merry
voices will sing along the shore at Condatchy,
when the last signal-gun has brought back the
last boat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a long pause before Marana ventured
to utter the more important question,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father! will any one be waited for in the
paradise under the sea?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Charmer rubbed his hand over his brow,
and said that this was the point he was endeavouring
to ascertain when his daughter entered.
His indications were at variance; and whether
the fishery was to be fatal to none, or to more
than he had put the question for, he could not
decide.—Marana felt that she must request Father
Anthony to intercede with, as well as praise the
saints.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.18'>18</span>“Is it a blind day to you, father?” she inquired,
struck by his tone of doubt on almost
every topic she had introduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My blind days are many,” he replied, “and
the blindness troubles me. Marcair looks doubtfully
upon me, and I look doubtfully upon myself,—because
I warned him that a wild elephant would
tread his rice-ground seven nights ago. Marcair
lighted eleven fires, and thirty-two friends kept
watch with him for three nights; and not a twig
was heard to snap in the jungle: and those who
laid ear to the ground say that not so much as a
panther trod within a mile.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Seven nights since? That was the night
that ball of white fire crossed the sky——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A ball of fire! St. Anthony opened your eyes
to see it! A ball of white fire cast from the hand
of a saint is more fearful than eleven fires kindled
by men’s hands.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The elephant was scared, father, no doubt.
The ball passed over that very jungle, and then
above Marcair’s rice-ground, and then into the
sea.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Charmer’s spirits were so raised by the
news of this interposition, that he presently contrived
to bring his most important calculations to
an agreement, and then lost no time in charming
the shell, that his daughter might be at liberty
to reveal to the neighbours what she had seen
on the seventh preceding night, and thus re-establish
her father’s credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had never heard her father speak more
positively on any point than on this,—that if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.19'>19</span>Rayo was married to her before he went out to
the fishery, this charm would bring Rayo back
safe from the fishery.—It followed that Rayo
should have his wish, and be married before the
adventure. There being no dwelling ready nor
any thing to put therein, was a matter of small
moment in comparison with Rayo’s safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana went forth with her usual slow and
demure step and demeanour: but the torches
which flashed here and there on her path were
reflected back from her eyes as brightly as from
the topazes on the crown of her head. With a
lighter, but no less graceful touch than usual,
did she unfurl the fan-like talipot leaves of which
the tents for the strangers were composed. With
more than her usual fancy did she feather with
cocoa-nut leaves the poles of bamboo to which
torches were to be fastened at intervals along the
road. She was too poor to pay the tribute of
white cotton cloth for the government agent to
walk upon, when he should arrive within sight of
the huts: but she had a new song to offer, which
was worth full as much. She had, besides, a
little cocoa-nut oil to spare for the anointing of
a sister beauty or two, when she had made her
own toilet: so that the remark went round that
Marana must have got some new charm from
her father for her special adornment. Rayo’s
manner seemed to show that he thought so too.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>After the usual expenditure of anxiety, prudence,
jealousy, wrath and cunning, the letting of the
Pearl banks had been accomplished. A great
speculator had offered government a certain sum
for the whole fishery of the season, and had then
let the different banks to various merchants, to
whom the gracious permission was given to
make what they could of the natives of the land
as well as of the sea;—not only to appropriate
the natural wealth of the region, but to bring its
inhabitants as near to the brink of starvation as
they pleased in their methods of employing their
toil. Pearls seem to be thought beautiful all
over the world where they have been seen. Empresses
in the north, ladies of all degree in the
east and west, and savages between the tropics,
all love to wear pearls; and where is there
a woman, in an Esquimaux hut or a Welsh
farmhouse, who would not wear pearls if she
could obtain them? And why should not all
have pearls who wish for them, if there is a
boundless store, and labourers enough willing
and ready to provide them? Alas! there are
not only few wearers of pearls because the interests
of the many are not consulted, but the
labourers who obtain them are by the same cause
kept bare of almost the necessaries of life, going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.21'>21</span>forth hungry and half naked to their toil, and returning
to seek rest amidst the squalidness of
poverty, while hundreds and thousands of their
families and neighbours stand on the shore
envying them as they depart, and preparing
to be jealous of them on their return: both parties
being, all the while, the natural owners of
the native wealth of their region. And why is
all this injustice and tyranny? That a few, a very
few, may engross a resource which should enrich
the many. Yet, not many things are more
evident than that to impoverish the many is
the most certain method of ultimately impoverishing
the few; and the reverse. If the government
would give away its pearl banks to
those who now fish those banks for the scantiest
wages which will support life, government would
soon gain more in a year from the pearls of
Ceylon than it has hitherto gained by any five
fisheries. If buyers might bid for pearls from
every quarter of the world to those who might
sell any where, and after their own manner, Cingalese
huts of mud and rushes would grow into
dwellings of timber and stone; instead of bare
walls, there would be furniture from a thousand
British warehouses; instead of marshes, there
would be rice-fields; instead of rickety coasting
boats, there would be fleets of merchantmen
riding in the glorious harbours of the island;
instead of abject prayers from man to man as
the one is about to suffer the dearth which the
other inflicts, there would be the good will and
thanksgiving which spring from abundance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.22'>22</span>instead of complaints on the one hand of expensive
dependence, and murmurs about oppression
on the other, there would be mutual congratulation
for mutual aid. Ceylon would over pay, if
required, in taxes, if not in advantageous commerce,
any sacrifice of the monopolies by which
she has been more thoroughly and ingeniously
beggared than any dependency on which British
monopoly has exercised its skill; and Britain might
disburthen her conscience of the crime of perpetuating
barbarism in that fairest of all regions,
for whose civilization she has made herself responsible.
There are many methods of introducing
civilization; and some very important ones have
been tried upon this beautiful island, and with as
much success as could be expected: but the most
efficacious,—the prime method,—is only beginning
to be tried,—the allowing the people to
gain the property which nature has appointed as
their share of her distribution. Let the Cingalese
gather their own pearls, exchange their own
timber, sell their own dyes wherever and in
whatsoever manner they like, and they will soon
understand comfort, and care for luxuries, like
all who have comforts and luxuries within their
reach; and with these desires and attainments
will come the perceptions of duty,—the new
sense of obligation which it is the object of all
plans of civilization to introduce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Great pains had been taken to civilize Rayo.
He had been schooled and watched over—he
could read, and he respected the religion of his
priest; he was willing to toil, and had a taste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.23'>23</span>for comfort. But, beyond the hope of acquiring
a hut and a mat or two, there was little stimulus
to toil, and as little to conduct himself with a
view towards any future circumstances. Strangers
not only carried away the wealth of the land, but
they prevented that wealth from growing, and
therefore the labour of the inhabitants from obtaining
a wider field. As pearls were fished
ten years before, so they would be fished ten
years hence, for any probability that he saw to
the contrary. A thousand divers carried away a
pittance then, insufficient to bring over to them
the desirable things which were waiting on the
shores of the neighbouring continent for a demand;
and a like pittance might such another
thousand carry away in time to come; in like
manner might they sigh for foreign commodities,
and in like manner might foreign commodities be
still waiting, wrought or unwrought, for a demand.
Therefore was Rayo still in a state of
barbarism, though he understood and praised the
trial by jury, and could read the prayers of his
church. He was in a state of barbarism, for
these accomplishments had no influence on his
conduct and his happiness. He was selfish in
his love; fraudulent with an easy conscience in his
transactions of business; and capable of a revenge
towards his superiors as remorseless as his deportment
was gentle and polished. No circumstance
had ever produced so happy an effect
upon him as his advancement to be a pearl-diver,
an advancement in dignity, if not in gain. It
was the last promotion he was ever likely to obtain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.24'>24</span>but, besides that it softened his heart by
occasioning his immediate marriage, it gave him
the new object of distinguishing himself, and
opened the possibility of his profiting by some stray
pearl, or by some chance opportunity of speculating
on a lot of oysters. He walked to join
his company on the beach with a demeanour unlike
that by which Rayo was commonly known;
and his young wife looked after him with a new
feeling of pride.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was sure to be as safe as on shore, for
the Charmer was to go in the same boat, and
no shark binder of the whole assemblage was
more confident of having effectually bound the
sharks than Marana’s father. All were confident;
and the crowds on the beach looked as
joyous for the night as if the work was going on
for their sakes. A city of bowers seemed to
have sprung up like Jonah’s gourd, or like the
tabernacles which, in old times of Jewish festivals,
made Jerusalem a leafy paradise for a short
season of every year. Talipot tents, and bamboo
huts dressed with greens and flowers were clustered
around the sordid dwellings on the sands.
Throngs of merchants and craftsmen, black,
tawny, and white, with their variety of costumes,
mingled in this great fair. The polisher of jewels
was there with his glittering treasure. The pearl-driller
looked to his needles and pearl dust, while
awaiting on his low seat the materials on which
he was to employ his skill. The bald, yellow-mantled
priest of Budhoo passed on amidst obeisances
in one place, as did the Catholic pastor in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.25'>25</span>another. The white vested Mahomedan, the
turbaned Hindoo, the swathed Malay merchants
exhibited their stores, or looked passively on the
gay scene. The quiet Dutchman from the south
sent a keen glance through the market in quest
of precious stones in the hands of an ignorant or
indolent vender. The haughty Candian abated
his fierceness, and stepped out of the path of the
European; while the stealthy Cingalese was in
no one’s path, but won his way like a snake in
the tall grass of the jungle. The restless lessees
of the banks, meanwhile, were flitting near the
boats, now ranged in a long row, each with its platform,
ropes and pullies; each with its shark-binder,
its pilot, its commander, its crew of ten,
and its company of ten divers. The boat-lights
were being kindled, one by one, and scattering a
thousand sparkles over the rippling tide. It was
just on the stroke of ten, and the signal gun was
all that was waited for. The buzz of voices fell
into a deep silence as the expectation became
more intense. Those who were wont to make
the heavens their clock and the stars its hour-hand,
looked up to mark the precise inclination
of the Southern Cross; while those who found an
index in the flow of the tide, paced the sands
from watermark to watermark. Yet more turned
their faces southward towards the dark outline of
hill and forest that rose on the horizon, and
watched for the land breeze. It came,—at first
in light puffs which scarcely bowed the rushes
around the lagoons, or made a stir among the
stalks in the rice-ground. Moment by moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.26'>26</span>it strengthened, till the sails of the boats began to
bulge, and every torch and faggot of cocoa-nut
leaves on the beach slanted its forks of flame
towards the sea, as if to indicate to the voyagers
their way. Then the signal-gun boomed, its
wreath of smoke curled lazily upward and dispersed
itself in the clear air, while a shout, in
which every variety of voice was mingled, seemed
to chase the little fleet into the distance. The
shouting ceased amidst the anxiety of watching
the clusters of receding lights, which presently
looked as if they had parted company with those
in the sky, and had become a degree less pure
by their descent. Then rose the song of the
dancing-girls, as they stood grouped, each with
a jewelled arm withdrawn from beneath her
mantle, and her jet-black hair bound with strings
of pearl. Mixed with their chaunt, came the
mutterings and gabblings of the charmers who
remained on shore, contorting their bodies more
vehemently than would have been safe on any
footing less stable than terra-firma.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most imposing part of the spectacle was
now to the people at sea. As their vessels were
impelled by an unintermitting wind through the
calmest of seas, they were insensible to motion,
and the scene on shore, with its stir and its sound,
seemed to recede like the image of a phantasmagoria,
till the flickering lights blended into one
yellow haze in which every distinct object was
lost. It became at length like a dim star, contrasting
strangely in brightness and in hue with
the constellation which appeared to rise as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.27'>27</span>rapidly as majestically over the southern hills,
like an auxiliary wheeling his silent force to restore
the invaded empire of night. Night now
had here undisputed sway; for the torches which
flared at the prows of the boats were tokens of
homage, and not attempts at rivalship of her splendours.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sailing is nearly as calculable a matter on
these expeditions as a journey of fifty miles in
an English mail-coach. There is no need to
think about the duration of the darkness, in a region
where the days and nights never vary more
than fifteen minutes from their equal length; and,
as for a fair wind, if it is certain that there will
be one to carry you straight out at ten to-night,
it is equally certain that there will be an opposite
one to bring you straight in before noon to-morrow.
Nature here saves you the trouble of
putting engine and paddle-box into your boat, in
order to be able to calculate your going forth and
your return. By the time the amber haze in the
east was parting to disclose the glories of a tropical
sunrise, the fleet was stationed in a circle
over the banks. Every stray shark had received
its commands to close its jaws, and hie back to
Adam’s Bridge; and on each side of every platform
stood five men, every one with his foot
slung on the pyramidal stone, whose weight must
carry him nine fathoms down into the regions of
monstrous forms and terrifying motions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo was one who was thus in readiness. He
stood next to the Charmer,—Marana’s father,—over
whom a change seemed to have come since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.28'>28</span>he left the land. It might be from the fasting
necessary to his office; it might be from the
intensity of his devotion; but it might also be
from fear, that his hands shook as he fumbled
among his sacred furniture, and his voice quavered
as he chaunted his spells. Rayo perceived
his disorder, and a qualm came over the heart of
the young diver,—a qualm such as assails the
servile agent of a rich man’s prosperity much
sooner than one in whom independence brings
bravery. Rayo looked keenly at the Charmer;
but the Charmer avoided meeting his eye, and
it was not permitted to interrupt his incantation.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was, perhaps, not the better for Rayo that
the opposite five went first,—it gave more time
for the unstringing of his nerves. The splash of
the thousand men who descended within the circle
took away his breath as effectually as the closing
waters were about to deprive him of it. It was
a singular sight to see the half of this vast marshalled
company thus suddenly engulphed, and
to think of them, in one moment after, as forming
a human population at the bottom of the sea.
To be a subject of the experiment was to the full
as strange as to witness it, as Rayo found, when
the minute of his companions’ submersion was at
length over, and a thousand faces (very nearly
scarlet, notwithstanding their tawny skins) rushed
up through the green wave. Spouting, dripping,
and panting, they convulsively jerked their burden
of oysters out upon the platform, and then
tried to deliver their news from the regions below;
but for this news their comrades must not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.29'>29</span>wait. Down went Rayo, to find out the difference
between three fathoms and nine. How far
the lively idea of a shark’s row of teeth might
have quickened his perceptions, he did not himself
inquire; but he was conscious of a more
dazzling flash before his eyes, a sharper boring
of the drum of his ear, and a general pressure so
much stronger than ever before, that it would
have been easy for him to believe, if he had been
a Hindoo, like his neighbours, that he supported
the tortoise that supported the elephant that supported
the globe. He could see nothing at first
in the dizzy green that was suffocating and boiling
him; but that did not signify, as he had no
time to look about him. He thought he was descending
clean into a shark’s jaws, so sharp was
that against which his left great toe struck, when
his descent from the ninth heaven to the ninetieth
abyss was at length accomplished. (How
could any one call it nine fathoms?) On meeting
this shark’s tooth, or whatever it was, yelling
was found to be out of the question. It was
luckily forgotten in the panic, that the rope was
to be pulled in case of accident;—luckily, as
there was no alternative between Rayo’s losing
all credit as a diver, and the fishing being at an
end for that day, from his spreading the alarm of
a shark. He did not pull the rope; he only pulled
up his left leg vigorously enough to assure himself
that it was still in its proper place; by which time
he discovered that he had only mistaken a large,
gaping oyster for a hungry shark. Rayo’s great
toe being not exactly the viand that this oyster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.30'>30</span>had a longing for, it ceased to gape, and Rayo
manfully trampled it under foot, before wrenching
it from the abode of which its seven years’ lease
had this day expired. These oysters required a
terrible wrenching, considering that there was no
taking breath between. Now he had got the
knack. A pretty good handful, that!—St. Anthony!
where did that slap in the face come
from—so cold and stunning? Rayo’s idea of a
buffet from the devil was, that it would be hot;
so he took heart, and supposed it was a fish, as
indeed it was. He must go now,—O! O! he
must go. He should die now before he could
get up through that immeasurable abyss. But
where was the rope? St. Anthony! where was
the rope? He was lost! No! it was the rope
slapped his face this time. Still he was lost!
A shadowy, striding mountain was coming upon
him,—too enormous to be any fish but a whale.
Suppose Rayo should be the first to see a whale
in these seas! St. Anthony! It was one of his
companions. If they were not gone up yet,
could not he stay an instant longer, and so avoid
being made allowance for as the youngest diver
of the party? No, not an instant. He rather
thought he must be dead already, for it was hours
since he breathed. He was alive enough, however,
to coil himself in the rope. Then he went
to sleep for a hundred years; then,—what is
this? dawn? A green dawn?—brighter,—lighter,—vistas
of green light everywhere, with
wriggling forms shooting from end to end of
them. Pah! here is a mouthful of ooze. Rayo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.31'>31</span>should not have opened his mouth. Here is the
air at last! Rayo does not care; the water does
as well by this time. If he is not dead now,
water will never kill him, for he has been a lifetime
under it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Rayo,” says the captain, “you have
done pretty well for the first time. You have
been under water a full minute, and one man is
up before you. Here comes another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A full minute!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Even so. Who has not gone through more
than this in a dream of less than a minute? and
yet more if he has been in sudden peril of instant
death, when the entire life is lived over
again, with the single difference of all its events
being contemporaneous? Since it is impossible
to get into this position voluntarily, let him who
would know the full worth of a minute of waking
existence, plunge nine fathoms deep,—not in the
sandy ooze of a storm-vext ocean, where he might
as well be asleep for anything that he will see,—but
in some translucent region which Nature has
chosen for her treasury.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo had re-discovered one of the natural uses
of air; but he was in despair at the prospect before
him. Forty or fifty such plunges as this
to-day! and as many more to-morrow, and
almost every day for six weeks! Forty or fifty
life-times a-day for six weeks! This is not the
sort of eternity he had ever thought of desiring:
and if purgatory is worse, Father Anthony had
not yet spoken half ill enough of it. Rayo had
better turn priest: he could speak eloquently
now on any subject connected with duration.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.32'>32</span>Before the end of the day’s work, however, the
impression was much weakened. The minutes
of submersion grew shorter, fish and their shadows
more familiar, and much of the excessive heat
and cold were found to have proceeded from
within. Before noon, Rayo could consider of
certain things to be attended to on the platform,
as well as on the oyster-bed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oysters gape sometimes in the air as well as in
the water. As Rayo floated in the intervals of his
plunges, (having grown so hardy as to resist the
remonstrances of the Charmer,) he observed the
commander take the opportunity of slipping a
morsel of wood into any oyster-shell that might
happen to open, to prevent its closing again, and
thus to save the necessity of waiting for the putrefaction
of the fish before its treasure could be
extracted. Rayo also perceived, that by an unheeded
touch of the commander’s foot, one of
these oysters was dislodged from its horizontal
position, and slipped with its hinge uppermost,
so as to give exit to a large white pearl, so round
that it rolled on and on, till it was stopped by a
piece of rope, under whose shadow it lay apparently
unperceived. It would have been risking
too much to mount the boat in this present interval,
for the purpose of picking up the pearl.
Rayo must wait till after the next plunge; and
in the meantime, it was but too probable somebody
would move the rope, and either discover
the pearl, or let it run away to some useless
place. Such a pearl as this was worth all the
chanks that Marana had cast away, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.33'>33</span>the right-handed one. Such a pearl as this would
build a boat as well as a house, and make Marana
look like a bride indeed. Such a pearl as this
was no more than Rayo believed the proper
payment of his labour, considering that strangers
carried away all the profit from the country
people. Such a pearl—this very pearl—might
have come into his possession, if he had taken
the chance, like some of his companions, of a lot
of oysters, instead of small, fixed wages. In
short, Rayo designed to have the pearl, and found
means of justifying the act of dishonesty, which
he would have strongly scrupled if he had been
serving a party in whose prosperity he was interested,
instead of one who interfered with the
prosperity of himself and his countrymen. What
Father Anthony had taught served little other
purpose at present than quickening Rayo’s ingenuity
in finding reasons for doing whatever
suited him. Such instruction might confirm and
exalt his integrity, when he should have any.
In the meantime, his social circumstances did
more to make him dishonest than his religion to
render him honest.</p>

<p class='c001'>When he came up next time, he made so
much haste to scramble into the boat, and
seemed so much hurried that the Charmer started
up in terror lest he should have lost a limb,—an
accident which the binder of sharks had been
expecting all the morning, from a complete
failure of confidence in his own skill. When he
saw that all was safe, he very nearly forgot his
dignity so far as to assist the youth in emptying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.34'>34</span>his net of oysters upon the heap in the middle of
the platform. He stopped short, however, on
Rayo’s repulsing his offers of help, and went back
to his seat, commending the practice of coming
on board instead of floating between the plunges.
Rayo sank down on his knees to empty his
pouch. The rope was within reach, and under
it still lay the pearl. It was very natural for
Rayo to draw the rope towards him, if he really
wanted to ascertain whether the one round his
body was strong enough; but it was not equally
natural for him to put his hand to his mouth
under pretence of dashing the wet from his face
where little wet remained. So, at least, the
commander thought; and he was confirmed by
observing a hasty effort to swallow when Rayo
was summoned to descend again. Measures of
which the youth little dreamed were in preparation
for him while he was down. He was hoisted
upon the platform, and before he knew what he
was about, a man seized him by either arm, a
third stepped behind him, flourishing a knotted
rope, while a fourth presented a cocoa-nut shell
of liquid, which did not look or smell very
tempting. He was told of a summary sentence
to be flogged for putting his hand to his mouth
while within arm’s-length of oysters, (a great
crime in Ceylon, whatever it may be elsewhere,)
and to swallow a strong emetic as the ordeal of
innocence of a further crime. It would have
been useless to attempt to upset the cup; for a
double dose would have been the consequence,
an ample stock of emetics being the part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.35'>35</span>apparatus of pearl-fishing least grudged by the
speculators. Bolting was equally impossible.
There was nothing for it but to bolt the medicine.
The pearl of course appeared, in due time; and
when it once more vanished beneath the lid of
the commander’s spring-box, the fairest of poor
Rayo’s hopes vanished with it. He might consider
himself, not disgraced,—for his companions were
wont to applaud the act of stealing pearls,—but
turned off from his employment for this bout, and
precluded from the means of establishing Marana
in any thing better than four bare mud walls.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pillal Karra,” (binder of sharks,) “you are
wise,” observed the commander respectfully. “I
have seen your downcast looks. Doubtless you
knew what should befal this youth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If any doubted our power,” said the Charmer,
“they should observe how a mysterious trouble
comes first to foreshow the misfortune that will
follow. When I was younger, I was content to
keep off the misfortune; and when I was over-ruled
by the Malabar hags, to let the mischief
come without warning to myself. Now when
my mind is tossed, I am learning to know that
the Malabar hags are riding a coming storm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have these hags bewitched your son-in-law?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt; and I know which of them it
is. It is Amoottra, who owes me a grudge on
account of Marana’s beauty. If she could meet
my daughter out of the line of my charms, she
would touch her with leprosy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; if you can convince my employer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.36'>36</span>this, and disenchant Rayo, he may come out
again to-morrow. Otherwise, he has taken his
last plunge for this season; for there parts the
first boat from the circle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As the boats warped round into line, the sea-breeze
freshened, and all were presently making
a steady progress homewards. Almost as soon
as they came in sight of the orange-tinted shore,
apparently floating in the hot haze of noon, they
saw a spark glitter, and some seconds after came
the boom of the signal-gun which was to announce
their return to the anxious speculators and
the public at large in the fair. The flag was
next hoisted, and then every man, woman, and
child was looking to seaward while hastening to
secure standing-room on the margin of the tide.
The Charmers began to be ambiguous about this
day’s success, and to prophesy magnificently for
the next. The dancing girls stationed themselves
round certain matted enclosures, ready to
welcome the oysters to their place of putrefaction.
Father Anthony borrowed a telescope of
a contractor, whose hand shook so that he could
make no use of it himself; and Marana stood
apart under the shade of a talipot leaf, lowering
her primitive umbrella, with tantalizing constancy,
as often as a gallant stranger or a curious
country-woman would have peeped under it.</p>

<p class='c001'>A talipot leaf will shelter two heads, and hide
two faces, as was soon proved with Marana’s.
Rayo did not particularly wish to encounter
Father Anthony, and had withdrawn Marana
among the huts, where, screened by the umbrella,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.37'>37</span>they mourned the adventure. Father Anthony’s
eyes, however, were keen. Keenly they peered
under the shelter, and made Rayo’s droop before
them. In vain Rayo pleaded his father-in-law’s
word, that he was bewitched by a Malabar hag.
Father Anthony did not allow Malabar hags to
lay waste the fold of which he was the shepherd.—Rayo
bowed his head submissively, and waited
for orders.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not insult the contractor by a plea of
witchcraft.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not, father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not seek to be employed again this season.
There are many waiting for the office who
deserve it better than you. For this season, I
shall recommend Tilleke in your place; by next
season, I hope you will have wrestled with temptation,
so that I may send my blessing forth with
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is the blessing passed away?” asked Rayo,
prostrating himself before the priest, with deep
sorrow in his tone and countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps not, if you will freely confess.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will, father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana moved away, and remained out of
hearing with her back turned towards them, till
the priest at length passed her. Dropping a few
words of good cheer, he exhorted her to be a
tender wife, but withal faithful to her religion,
and then he trusted Rayo would become proof
against every kind of evil instigation or influence.
It really was remarkable that such influences
seemed to beset him in particular places.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.38'>38</span>His sins of theft took place at sea, where compunction
never seemed to visit him; while no
one could be more penitent and submissive than
Rayo on land. Did Marana know of any instance
of his committing a theft on shore, or
being penitent at sea? Marana could recollect
none, and was confirmed in her dread
of the Malabar witch. If she could but get
Rayo farther inland!—she said to herself, as
father Anthony gave her his blessing, and went
on his way.</p>

<p class='c001'>This aspiration was nearer its accomplishment
than she could have supposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rayo, what could make you take the pearl?”
she asked, when she returned to her husband.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If there were a cocoa-nut tree here, as in the
south, I should not want the money which I
cannot get. We might build under its shade,
and eat its fruit, and drink the milk from the
kernel, and make our ropes of its fibres, and burn
lamps of its oil. But as there are no cocoa-nuts
where we live, I got chanks. You threw them
away, and I tried to get a pearl. If I must not
have a pearl——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us go to the cocoa-trees, as they cannot
come to us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I go at all, I will go far;—down among
the cinnamon gardens, Marana.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not to be a cinnamon peeler!” exclaimed
Marana, who thought she saw a desperation in
her husband’s countenance, such as a man might
wear who was about to lose caste. It was now
a disputed point which caste ought to rank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.39'>39</span>highest,—the fishermen or the cinnamon-peelers;
but Marana, as in duty bound, as a fisherman’s
daughter, regarded the cinnamon-peelers as upstarts.
“You, a fisherman, will not mix with
the cinnamon-peelers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo explained no more of his purpose in
going among the cinnamon gardens than that it
was not to mix with the peelers. But he gloomily
hinted that perhaps Marana ought not to go,—would
she not there be out of the limit of her
father’s charms? Might not the hag Amoottra——</p>

<p class='c001'>“Touch me with leprosy? No,” said Marana,
producing the precious shell from a corner
of her mantle. “My father needs not draw out
his spell at home while I carry this with me. I
have shown it to you, Rayo, but you will not
sell it? If we live among the cocoa-nuts, we
shall not want the money. You will not take it
from me to part with it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo let her deposit it in her mantle, and then
she was ready to go. Every thing that she
possessed was now on her person. Her father
was certain, from the nature of his profession,
of being well taken care of; and, if not, her
husband’s claims upon her would have been
paramount. Leaving the Charmer to discover
by his spells why and whither they were gone,
and old Gomgode to catch fish for himself and
his daughter, the young folks stole away towards
the richer country to the south. They knew
that there was little danger of pursuit. There
was no lack of divers to supply Rayo’s place.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.40'>40</span>Nobody supposed they would actually starve;
and, as for living poorly, it was what thousands
had done before them, thousands were
doing now, and thousands would do after them.
Gomgode supposed Rayo would preserve caste.
The charmer trusted his daughter not to expose
herself rashly to the hag’s wrath, as she knew
the consequences. Perhaps Father Anthony missed
and mourned them most; but he had a firm faith
that Rayo would prove an honester man in the
jungle, or among the paddy-fields, than on a
haunted sea.</p>

<h3 id='ch2.3' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <br> MORNING IN THE JUNGLE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>During the time of the cinnamon harvest, it
was the custom of Mr. Carr, the agent of the
East India Company for the management of
their cinnamon contract, to ride every morning
through one department or another of the Marandahn,
or great cinnamon garden near Columbo.
The beauty of the ride might afford
sufficient temptation at any season of the year.
The blue lake of Colombo, whether gleaming in
the sunrise, or darkening in the storms of the
monsoon, never lost its charms. The mountain
range in the distance was an object for the eye
to rest lovingly upon, whether clearly outlined
against the glowing sky, or dressed in soft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.41'>41</span>clouds, from which Adam’s Peak alone stood
aloft, like a dark island in the waters that are
above the firmament.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether the laurel-like cinnamon wore its
early foliage of red or its later of green, or its
white blossom that made the landscape dazzling
with beauty and voluptuous with fragrance;
whether the talipot upreared its noble crest of
straw-coloured blossoms above its green canopy,
or presented its clustering fruit; whether the
cocoa-nut tree bowed before the gusts of autumn,
or stood in dark, majestic clumps above the
verdure of a less lofty growth, the groves and
gardens were a paradise to the eye of the Europeans.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reaches of road, and the green paths
which might be detected here and there amidst
the vast plantation, the rice grounds and patches
of meadow land interspersed, and the lowly roof
peeping out occasionally from beneath the palms,
gave hints of the presence of man and civilization;
while the temple, with its oriental dome
supported on slender pillars, jutting out at the
extreme end of a promontory into the blue
waters of the lake, or perched on some point of
the piled rocks in the background, carried back
the thoughts to old days of barbarian superstition.
In all this there was so much pleasure as
to make a ride in the Marandahn a tempting
pleasure at all times and seasons; though Mr.
Carr’s interest was at its height during the cinnamon
harvest.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he was about to mount his horse one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.42'>42</span>morning, the sound of argument, not to say dispute,
reached him from within.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear child,” Mrs. Carr was saying,
“Roomseree and Pellikee shall give you an
airing nearer home, so that you will not be
killed with the heat. Do not think of going
with papa this morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, mama, you know papa says nothing tires
me. I can ride as far as papa; and papa says
he likes to show me what the people are doing;
and I am sure the people like me to go too.
Papa enjoys his ride so much more when I go
with him; and the horse does not think me very
heavy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Heavy! no, love! You are so small and
slight, Alice, that it makes me tremble to think
of your going out under such a sun as it will be
by the time you get back. Papa always promises
to take a very short ride; and it ends
with his bringing you home at the end of four
or five hours. Better stay with me, love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All the rest of the day, mama; but papa has
had the right saddle put on, and we are to go
the west ride this morning. Cannot you go to
sleep till we come back?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Carr promised to try; and, to do her
justice, she was always ready to do her best to
sleep, day and night, bidden and unbidden.
With a few sighs over the charming spirits and
the unquenchable curiosity of the dear child,
she closed her eyes on the dewy radiance of a
morning in paradise, and was glad that she had
nothing more to do with cinnamon than to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.43'>43</span>tired of hearing of it, and to taste it when she
pleased.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alice used her eyes to more purpose this
morning. She was yet new enough to scenes
like those before her to be full of wonder, and
other feelings, as natural, perhaps, but less
desirable.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Papa, do giants live in this place?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Giants, my dear, no. What made you
fancy such a thing? You have seen no very
amazing people, have you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; they are very small pretty people, I
think. Sometimes, when I see them under
such a very tall clump of trees as that, or
among the jungle grass, they put me more in
mind of dark fairies than giants; but——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the trees are some of them fit for
giants’ walking-sticks, I suppose you think;
and an elephant is a very proper animal for a
giant to ride. Hey?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have seen men on elephants,” replied
Alice. “But look there! Look at that great
castle!” And she pointed with awe to a mighty
object which was partially revealed as the morning
mists drew off.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is not a castle, my dear; though I do
not wonder at your taking it for one. It is a
mountain-peak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the drawbridge, papa;—the drawbridge
hanging in the air.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! you would be a long time in finding
out what that drawbridge (as you call it) is.
You think it made for giants; but it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.44'>44</span>break down under your weight. That is only
a bridge of creeping plants, for birds and butterflies
to hide in. If a strong wind came, you
would see it swing, like your swing between the
cherry trees in the orchard at your grandmama’s,
in England.—When we get out of the
garden and nearer the thickets, you will see
some such flowers as that bridge is made of,
hanging from the trees, and binding them together
so that we cannot ride through them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I do not want to get out of the garden
yet. Here come the people, one after another,
from their cottages, with their crooked knives to
cut down the branches. What are those tawny
people doing in the shade? They seem to be
sitting very comfortably, all in a ring. This is
prettier than seeing grandmama’s mowers in
England, besides that the mowers do not sing at
their work, like these people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The mowers in England have more reason
to sing than many of these peelers. Look how
thin many of them are; and that poor child
playing in the grass appears half-starved. Very
few people in England are so poor as some of
the natives here, who yet sing from morning till
night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alice observed that they were not all thin;
and she pointed to one man whose legs were of
an enormous size, and to another whose body
was nearly as broad as it was long.—She was
told that these appearances were caused by
disease; and that the diseases of the labourers
were in a great degree owing to their poor way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.45'>45</span>of living. There would be few such swollen or
emaciated bodies as these if the people had flesh
to eat, or good bread, or even the seasoning
which was necessary to make their vegetable
food agree with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Seasoning! What sort of seasoning?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Salt, and pepper, and cardamoms, and cinnamon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Salt, papa! They must be very lazy if they
do not get salt enough. There is the sea all
round Ceylon; and I have seen several ponds
where the water was so salt I could not drink
it. There was a crust of salt all about the edge,
papa.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very true, my dear; but the people are not
allowed to take it. The king of Candy lives in
the middle of this island; and the kings of
Candy have sometimes been troublesome people
to the English, as they were to the Dutch before
them. Now, as the king of Candy cannot get
to the sea, or to any salt lake, without our
king’s leave, he and his people depend upon us
for salt; and our government likes to keep him
quiet, and get a great price for its salt at the
same time by selling it to the Candians very
dear, and by letting nobody else sell any. So
the people of the country are not allowed to
help themselves to salt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if there was not enough, I would rather
make the king of Candy go without than these
poor people who belong to us. We ought to
take care of them first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The government likes to take care of itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.46'>46</span>before either its own people or the Candians.
There is salt enough for every body here, and
for half India besides; and large quantities are
destroyed every year, to keep up the price,
while many are dying for want of it, and those
who live can get nothing better than coarse
dirty salt which the beasts in your grandmama’s
farm-yard would turn away from. If we could
count the numbers of Hindoos who die in India
for want of the salt which their own country
produces, we should find that a fearful reckoning
awaits the Company there, as there does the
government here; a fearful balance of human
life against a high price for salt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alice thought that if the ghosts of these poor
natives could haunt the authorities, such an
army of shadows would soon prevail to secure
for their surviving countrymen the food which
Providence had made to superabound before
their eyes. She knew how shocked and sorry
government was that a woman here and there
burned herself when her husband died; but
when government burned the salt which was
left, in order to keep up the price, Alice thought,
and so did her father, that government was
destroying more lives than ever perished on
piles kindled by native hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But pepper, papa: the king of Candy can
grow his own pepper in his own woods, I
suppose; for it seems as if it would grow any
where here, as long as there are trees for it to
hang upon. I see the pepper vine dangling in
the woods, wherever I go; and the monkeys
throw the red clusters at each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.47'>47</span>“The monkeys may gather them, but the men
and women may not, unless they are employed
to do so by the government. The monkeys
cannot pay for pepper, and some of the people
can; therefore the people who cannot must go
without, or steal, and run the risk of being
punished.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor people!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Miserably poor, indeed. If they were allowed
to grow as much pepper as they pleased,
and sell it to any part of the world where it is
wished for, they would have a great deal of
money wherewith to buy things which the government
could sell much more profitably than
pepper. Then we should see mats, strewed with
pepper-corns, spread in many a nook of the
thickets which the panther and the snake now
have all to themselves; and many a child would
be heard singing among the vines, which now
moans its little life away in its half-starved
mother’s arms. The same may be said of cardamoms.
There is no one in these eastern countries
who would not eat cardamoms if he could get
them; and there are endless tracts where cardamoms
would grow; and yet very few of the
natives can obtain them to eat. Cardamoms grow
wherever vegetable ashes are found in this
country. The plant naturally springs up on the
very spots where other precious things have
been burned before the people’s eyes; but the
plant must be rooted up, or its capsules left to be
avoided as forbidden fruit, unless offered to the
government for sale. But government gives so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.48'>48</span>low a price for cardamoms, that the people have
little heart to cultivate the plant.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what does the government do with cardamoms?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It sells them; but not to half so many
people as would be glad to buy. If government
would let the people freely sell cardamoms, government
would have a people rich enough to
pay more in taxes than government will ever
make by selling cardamoms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you said the people might not have cinnamon.
How can any body prevent their getting
it? Look all round, papa. As far as we can
see on this side and on that, and a great way
before us, it is one wood of cinnamon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, my dear. This one garden is fifteen
miles round.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, why cannot the people steal as much
as they please? If I were a poor native, I
would cut down all I could get, and sell enough
to make a great deal of money, and then buy
what I wished for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for the cutting it down, my dear, the
natives would have little scruple; for, like all
people who are cruelly pinched, they are apt to
take what they can get without caring to whom
it belongs. But how are they to sell it when
they have got it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought you said that cinnamon grew
scarcely anywhere in the world but here; and I am
sure there are plenty of people all over the world
who are fond of it, and would be glad to buy it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very true; but those who long to sell and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.49'>49</span>those who long to buy cannot get at each other.
Somebody steps between to prevent the bargain.
The English government lets the East India
Company have all the cinnamon you see, on condition
of the Company paying so much a-year.
So the spice is carried away to be sold, instead
of foreign nations being allowed to come here to
buy; and none is left but that which the Company
does not think it worth while to carry away;
and even that is sometimes burned to keep up
the price.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Burned! when so many people would be
glad of it! Would not the common people in
England like it, if they could get it as cheap as
salt? If they did, they would make the fortunes
of the people here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then the people here would make the
fortunes of a great many of the working people
in England. This would certainly be the case.—What
do you think the people in England eat
most of, Alice?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bread, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and salt comes next. And what next?—Another
sort of seasoning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not pepper, nor mustard; but something
that every body liked and used,—from the
infant that will leave sucking its thumb for it, to
the old man that has but one tooth left in his
head;—from the king who lets his queen put it
into his coffee, to the labourer’s wife who carries
home a coarse sample of it on the Saturday night.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That must be sugar. But I think almost
every thing that is good with sugar would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.50'>50</span>better with cinnamon; and if cinnamon was
made very cheap, what a quantity would be used,
and how rich the growers might be! They would
grow more and more, and employ more people,
till this whole large island was one great cinnamon
garden——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Every part of it that is fit for such a purpose;
every part that has a light dry sandy soil
like that which we are riding over so pleasantly.
And then much more use would be made of the
rest of the land, the richer the inhabitants grew.
There would be more rice, and more fruits, and
more dye-woods, and more timber, and more of
all the useful and beautiful things that this paradise
will produce.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alice wondered that the whole world did not
cry out for more cinnamon; and her father
agreed with her that such a cry would probably
be raised, if the greater part of the world did but
know how good cinnamon is. They never could
have known, or they would not so easily agree
to go without it, for the sake of the pockets of
the East India Company.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fact is, my dear, the Company and the
government do not behave so ill as some people
did before them. The cinnamon trade is a very
old trade;—as old as the time when the wise and
wealthy Egyptians used to trade with the rich
and barbarous princes of India; but, though
this trade has passed through many hands, there
has never been liberty to buy and sell as natural
wants and wishes rise. Three hundred years ago,
the Portuguese came here, and drove out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.51'>51</span>turbaned Moors, and sold cinnamon at their own
price to the world, (and let the natives have
none of the benefit of it,) for more than a hundred
and thirty years. Then came the Dutch to take
the matter out of the hands of the Portuguese,
and they let the world have a little and a little
more, by degrees, till they prepared the way for
a fine commerce for us, if we had but known
how to make use of it. But the mistake of the
government of England is in letting nobody have
the spice who will not buy of us and pay our price
for it; when it is very plain that their money
would come round to England at last; and in
much greater plenty, if we let the natives grow
and the foreigners buy of them, as much as they
pleased.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Those poor people who are peeling, and
stopping their songs as we pass, and looking so
terribly afraid of us, seem as if they were not fit
to make a bargain, papa.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They would soon learn, my dear, if left
to manage their own interest. At present,
they know very well how to steal, but very
little how to conduct a fair bargain. The Cingalese
come begging and praying, almost
on their knees, that we will buy; and if we
condescend to ask their prices, they name twice
as much as they mean to take; and if we
choose to give them only half what they might
really look for, they cannot help themselves: or
if we have a fancy to pay them in betel-nut, or
tobacco, or cotton-cloth, or anything else we
may want to get rid of, they have nothing to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.52'>52</span>but to take it, or to carry back their commodity as
they brought it. These people, however,—these
peelers, have nothing to sell.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When we get among the cocoa groves, papa,
there are several cottages, and the people bring
out things to sell. I wish you would buy something
this morning; just to see how they will
manage, poor things! But who is this, papa?
He looks grander than the modelier, with his
gay petticoat and his blue dress. I do believe this
is Captain Cinnamon, as the peelers call him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is. He is the chief of the peelers, and he
is taking his morning round, as we are. I will
speak to him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Captain Cinnamon bent his turbaned head in
a profound obeisance to the little girl, as well as
to her father, which the young lady returned as
if she had been the far-famed pearl queen of the
olden time. Alice’s father and mother were
more amused than they ought to have been at
the airs of consequence she assumed among the
natives, and did not discourage the haughtiness
with which she naturally returned their homage.
Mr. Carr’s own manner, adapted to those he had
to deal with, was a bad example for her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll tell you what, captain, you must take
more care of your charge. I am certain there is
a great deal of pilfering going on in this garden,
and you are answerable to the Company for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The captain was all humility: but how should
there be thefts? For what purpose, as the
peelers could not sell this commodity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But others besides peelers may help themselves,
and do.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.53'>53</span>“The English gentlemen from the fort ride
through the garden,” modestly suggested the
captain.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nonsense! do you suppose they steal cinnamon?
I tell you I saw a head pop up yonder,
and a motion among the shrubs, where neither
cutting nor barking is going on: look there, and
you will find a thief, depend upon it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The captain owned that, secure as the Company
was of no interference with their monopoly
of the bark while the garden was under his care,
it was difficult to prevent persons from entering
to pluck the fruit. It was so easy to pull and
carry away the fruit unobserved, and it was so
precious to the people, and of so little use to the
Company, that Mr. Carr’s predecessor had connived
at the practice, and desired Captain Cinnamon
to do so too. As Mr. Carr thought differently,
however, the peasants of the jungle
should be humbled beneath his feet. In a trice,
half a score of peelers were called from their
work to hunt the thief; and a grand show of
zeal they made in beating among the shrubs,
and uttering cries.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, that will do,” said Mr. Carr, when Alice
had pointed out the gradual retreat of the moving
thing (as shown by the twitching of the bushes)
towards the ditch which bounded the garden.
“This will frighten him: now let him escape.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Little Alice now signified her will and pleasure
to be informed what was to become of the
quantity of bark which was strewed before her
eyes. Wherever there was a space between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.54'>54</span>shrubs where the sun could penetrate to the pure
white sand from which the spicy stems sprang,
mats were spread; and on these mats were
strewed and heaped rolls of the bark, the smaller
rolls being fitted into the larger, so as to contain
a great quantity of the commodity in a small
bulk.—On some open plots which they had already
passed, other such mats, heaped with other such
rolls, had greeted the senses of Alice and her
father; and wherever they caught glimpses
through side alleys of the wood, or reached an
eminence whence they could look abroad over
the expanse of shrubs, they saw dark forms
squatted on the white sand, or gemmed heads
rising amidst the verdure, while the rich scent
which declared their occupation diffused itself
through the still air. Though the hands of the
workmen moved languidly, (like the hands of
other workmen who do not labour for themselves,)
though the process of peeling was clumsy, and
the waste of material excessive, yet such quantities
of bark fell from innumerable boughs and
twigs that Alice could not imagine what was to
be done with it all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Captain Cinnamon told her (with obeisances
which were imitated and multiplied by his throng
of followers) that all this quantity of spice awaited
the disposal of her puissant father, the agent of
the Honourable Company; and that he would
probably inform her that when he had caused to
be packed that which his wisdom should deem
the proper quantity to be vouchsafed for the use
of the world, the rest would receive its sentence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.55'>55</span>of destruction or distribution from his lips.
Alice held up her head, and rode on, not quite
understanding the matter of fact about which she
had inquired, but thinking that it would be below
the dignity of so great a man’s daughter to appear
to need further information.</p>

<p class='c001'>The throng of attendants hovered round them
as long as they continued within the verge of the
garden—pointing out to the young lady here a
little stack of cinnamon awaiting the hands of the
packers; and there kneeling groups, with each
a chest in the centre, a heap of black pepper
lying beside it, to strew between the layers of
cinnamon, and pots of resin wherewith to stop
the seams and crevices of the chests. Alice
could not help learning much from what she saw,
notwithstanding the sudden start of pride which
made her prefer issuing commands to asking questions.
She felt a sad loss of consequence when her
father dismissed the peelers to their proper business,
on reaching the ditch which divided the
garden from the open country. She was now
no more than Alice Carr, riding before her father,
as she remembered having done long ago in a
field of grandmama’s in England, where there
were no black people to make bows, and gather
round her as if she were a princess.</p>

<p class='c001'>She complained of the narrowness of the path
through the close jungle, and was sorry that
they were leaving the lake farther and farther on
one side of them; but it was not long before
she found that there was here something to
admire. Grandmama’s horses had never trod
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.56'>56</span>such a path as that on which her steed was now
pacing: they had never entangled their feet in
trails of the blue convolvulus, or bowed their
heads to avoid being garlanded with creepers,—now
scarlet, now yellow, now white. They would
have started at the glittering snakes that wound
in the grass, and at the monkeys that hung by
one arm from the boughs overhead, gibbering
and chattering in a way that must move all unaccustomed
gazers to perpetual laughter. Instead
of one proud peacock, perched upon a wall,
to be gazed at by a populous neighbourhood,
here were numbers of those stately creatures,
fanning the long grass as they spread their burnished
tails, or making their rich purple hues
gleam from beneath the shades of the bowery
fig-tree. Nothing could be more unlike the
cottages of England than the dwellings which
emerged upon the sight, here and there, from
their hiding-places among the verdure. These
dwellings looked as if they were part and parcel
of the jungle, being formed of the wood and
leaves that grew there, fenced with shrubs, and
decked with creepers, which twisted themselves
over every part, so as scarcely to leave room for
the squirrels to pop in and out from their holes
in the leafy thatch. The enclosed plots (where
any cottage could boast such an acquisition)
were as little like the gardens of a civilized country.
No rows of cabbages and peas, no beds of
potatoes and onions—no supply of vegetables
on which a family may depend as some security
against starvation. The Cingalese, though blest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.57'>57</span>with a soil and climate in which every thing will
grow, are destitute of any such provision as a
tenth of the toil of an English labourer would
secure, and as a single gem from the necklace of
a native would purchase, in almost any land that
has not the misfortune to be a monopolized colony.
If any one in Ceylon has a fancy for potatoes
and onions, he must get them from Bombay. If
his ambition extends to peas and cabbages, he
must wait till they can be brought from England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The shaddock, the plantain, and the jack-fruit,
might be seen growing within these enclosures,
the little walks being spread with a covering as
bright and as curiously variegated as any mosaic
pavement, and as soft as the richest carpet.
Moss,—the scarlet, crimson, brown, yellow,
green, moss of Ceylon,—“the jewellers’ sorrow,”
as it is there called, from its beauty surpassing
any which the combinations of the lapidary can
produce, was tufted beneath the stems, and
spread under the feet. Instead of thieves of the
air, hovering in awe of the scarecrow which flaps
and nods in an English breeze, here were four-footed
pilferers peeping with longing looks from
neighbouring tree-tops, or swinging themselves
down from a convenient branch, or pushing out
what looked very like a human hand, to pluck,
or to grub up whatever might be within reach,
while the switch of the owner was absent. Instead
of the lowing of cows from the farm-yard,
and the cawing of rooks from the rustling trees,
and the cackle of geese from the bare pond on
the common, there was the chit-chat of monkeys,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.58'>58</span>the screaming of parrots, the timid step of the
gazelle among the dry twigs, and the splash of
teal and wild ducks from the pool beneath the
mangroves. Alice was obliged to be content
with tracking the deer with her eye; but at the
sound of water, she must turn aside and see
whence it came, notwithstanding the fear with
which her father ever approached, or allowed
any belonging to him to approach, water in
these swampy wildernesses. Just for one moment
he thought his little daughter might be
permitted to look around her; but when he had
penetrated a little farther into the shade, he repented
of his compliance. A fallen tree had
intercepted the course of the tiniest rivulet that
ever was seen, and had formed a pool, which
had spread and spread, till it had made an island
of one tree after another, and was now canopied
with a green shade, and mantled with the lotus,
and fringed with the bull-rush, from among
which rose the cry of waterfowl, and rainbow
visions of gigantic dragon-flies. Notwithstanding
all this beauty, Mr. Carr repented of having
penetrated these shades, so heavy felt the air,
and so oppressive was the moist smell of decaying
vegetation. A woman was stooping in the
grass, too, whose looks did not reassure him.
Fever or hunger had sunk her cheek, and given
such languor to her gait and gestures as to destroy
the grace which co-exists to a remarkable
degree with the indolence of demeanour which
distinguishes the natives of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is very like one of grandmama’s hens,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.59'>59</span>observed Alice, as the tawny lady disentangled
a fowl from the snare in the grass, and held the
fluttering bird against her bosom. “I could
almost fancy that was one of the fowls I used to
feed in the poultry-yard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at the cock, and you will see the difference,”
replied her father. “See what a lofty,
steady flight he takes half way up that tree,
whose lowest branch would allow your grandmama’s
sycamore to stand under it. Look at
the gay, glossy plumage of each fowl, and tell
me if you ever saw such on an English cock and
hen. These are the jungle-fowl you have heard
me speak of as a great blessing to the natives.
I hardly know what some of them would do for
food without jungle-fowl.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That woman looks as if she had not been
eating any,” observed Alice. “She looks as if
she had had nothing good to eat this long
while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So thought Mr. Carr; and he stopped to ask
her if the trees under which she dwelt were fruitful?
Marana (for it was she) replied, that her
husband and she could generally get cocoa-nuts
when they were hungry, but that they had sickened
many times under this diet, during the
short time that they had been in the jungle.
Her husband’s strength had wasted, and she
had had the ague; and it was but seldom that
she could snare a fowl.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did not her husband bring home game, or
earn money, or grow rice?</p>

<p class='c001'>He brought home little game, for want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.60'>60</span>means to take it. He could not grow rice, as
he had neither land nor seed; and as for earning
money, how was it possible for a stranger to do
so, when so many residents were already unemployed?</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true,” replied Mr. Carr, “that the
gardens are very full of people, some of whom
make more show of working than do any good;
but still——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana was too courteous to interrupt his
speech; but when he had paused for some time
to think, she declared that her husband must
not be supposed to desire to have anything to
do with the Challias, or cinnamon-peelers.
Rayo was of the fishermen’s caste.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, you must settle it between you which
is the highest caste. If you differ among yourselves
on such a point, a foreigner cannot be
expected to decide it. But why does your husband,
being a fisherman, come to live here?
Why does not he try his chance among the pearl
fishers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are too many there, as well as in the
gardens,” replied Marana.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Too many for what?” inquired Alice.
“There cannot be more men than pearls. Why
cannot they take it in turns to fish? And then,
if only one pearl was paid to every man, there
would be plenty left for the rich men who do not
fish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay; but then captains and merchants from
many nations would come: and that is just what
our government does not like. A French merchant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.61'>61</span>would carry away pearls, and leave silk
dresses behind him, or money, with which the
Cingalese might lay out rice-fields and cotton
plantations, or stock meadows with cattle. The
Dutch captain would go to some neighbouring
countries for grain, and would be paid in pearls.
The Russian would bring leather and corn, and
carry away pearls. The Englishman would bring
iron, and clothing of cotton, and a hundred comforts
besides, and would make a profitable bargain
of pearls.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But this would be a good thing for everybody,—for
the ladies who want more pearls, and
for these poor people, who want employment,
and food, and clothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the government must then leave off
paying as little as it likes to the pearl-fishers,
and being the only party to sell the fair white
pearls of Ceylon to all the beautiful ladies in
the world who can afford to obtain them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there are plenty of princes and great
men who would give away more pearls as presents,
if they could get them; and there must
be plenty of beautiful ladies who cannot get
pearls, because they are very dear. I should
like to give these people a boat, and send them
out to fish pearls for some of the ladies, who
would give a little less for their pearls, but quite
enough to make Rayo rich,—to buy him a rice-ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Though the fisher and the buyer are ready,
and the boat may soon be had, Rayo must do
without his rice-ground. The government will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.62'>62</span>not give him leave to sell pearls to anybody but
themselves, and they will not pay enough to buy
a rice-ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the first sound of buying and selling,
Marana had disappeared within the cottage.
She came forth again with her right-handed
chank, which she offered to Alice for sale, with
a sad and imploring look.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a pity you should sell this shell,” observed
Mr. Carr. “It is a very valuable one,
as you ought to know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then keep it,—it may be a little fortune to
you some day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We want rice, and my husband’s clothing
is old.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, food and dress are of more importance
than any shell, to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Than any shell but this, Marana thought; but
when the idea arose of the hag, and her threat
of leprosy, and of the curse which might now
pursue Rayo, she doubted whether anything
could be more important to her than this charmed
shell. Whether the curse had not already lighted
upon Rayo, she was doubtful; for never man
was so changed. He was as smooth and courteous
in his manner to strangers as formerly, and
as fond of her as he had ever been; but he was
not the indolent, careless, light-hearted youth
he had been when she had first known him on
the coast. He did not work, for there was no
work for him to do but to scramble up a tree
and down again when he wanted a cocoa-nut;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.63'>63</span>but he prowled about the neighbourhood, and
seemed to have some purpose which lay nearer
to his heart than his wife. Marana hoped that
he was not bewitched or doomed; but it always
alarmed her to meet him unawares in the thicket,
and to see how full his mind was of some thought
which the hardships of the day and the fever of
the night could not banish.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Alice was handling the shell, and longing
more and more for it, as she observed the
solicitude with which Marana watched her mode
of playing with it, a rustling was heard in the
wood, and Rayo himself burst from the covert,
with a rude sort of basket in his arms, which
seemed to be filled with the fruit of the cinnamon
shrub. At the unexpected sight of a stranger,
he turned quickly, and deposited his load in the
long grass behind him. While his back was
turned, his wife made a rapid sign to her visiters
to hide the chank, and say nothing about it,
which sign Mr. Carr obeyed by pocketing the
shell, and slipping into Marana’s hand gold,
which made a warm blush visible on her dark
cheek, and lighted up her dim eyes with a momentary
gleam. She had never held so much
money in her hand at one time before; and the
idea of the hag vanished for the instant before
the image of a basket of steaming rice, stewed
with cardamoms or peppercorns.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We must have a lamp,” half-whispered
Marana, observing that Mr. Carr sent a searching
glance after the acorn-like fruit that was
turned over in the grass. “And if Marana is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.64'>64</span>not anointed, how should her husband love
her?”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was a question which Mr. Carr’s European
habits unfitted him for answering. He
asked if there was no method of obtaining the
oil of the cinnamon fruit but by pilfering from
the garden? None, for poor creatures so weak
as these peasants, who could not penetrate into
the interior for such purposes. The garden was
close at hand; the cocoa-nut oil, with which the
oil of the cinnamon fruit was to be mixed, hung
overhead; and the temptation was too strong
to allow of Mr. Carr’s being very angry. He
asked how the oil was made to serve the purpose
of a lamp during the dark nights, when it became
the office of the invalids to watch and nurse each
other? Marana produced her lamp,—half the
shell of a cocoa-nut, supported on a stick of
ebony, which was stuck into a little block of
calaminda wood. On the surface of the oil
which the shell contained, floated a little wick,
formed from the pith of a rush. Nothing could
be more primitive; few things more elegant;
and the materials were such as would in few
other countries have been found in the habitation
of persons in want of proper food.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alice was bent upon purchasing the lamp
also; and small was the price demanded, however
Marana might wonder at her husband’s
demand not being so much as disputed. Busily
did she attempt to fulfil her task of making another
lamp, and bruising the fruit from which the
oil was to be drained, while Rayo seemed to
have a sudden fancy for making torches.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.65'>65</span>Meantime, Mr. Carr cleared the jungle; and,
seeing that the sky was blackening towards the
west, as if with the first storms of the monsoon,
turned his horse’s head homeward, bestowing
many a thought on the natives whom he saw in
field, garden, jungle, and road,—all obsequious,
and looking up to every Englishman they met,
as if impressed with profound gratitude, while
most were poor and comfortless, and it was certain
that all were injured by the nominal protection
of their country. Even Alice, occupied as
she was with looking about her for homage, and
with planning an exhibition of her two treasures
to her mother, could not wholly forget the sunken
countenances of those who appeared to be pining
in the luxuriant region which she had just left,
and where Nature seemed to intend that all
things should flourish.</p>

<h3 id='ch2.4' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br> <br> NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Almost all who lived to the west of Adam’s
Peak looked with glad eyes to the lowering sky
which hung over the sea like a leaden canopy.
The rains came late this year; the rice-fields
languished; the verdure seemed to crave of the
light clouds which floated around the mountaintops
that they would descend in showers. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.66'>66</span>was now a prospect of rain in abundance, and
all looked for it with impatience but Marana,
to whose troubled spirit the moaning of the
rising wind in the trees, and the dull roar of
the distant sea spoke of hags riding the blast,
and curses cradled in the clouds. As she sat
this evening at the door of her hut, weaving
a basket of cane which her own hands had
cut, dried, and split, she glanced up uneasily to
the sky, where the twilight was being rapidly
quenched by the rolling vapours, and started at
every fire-fly that brushed past her, as if it had
been a spark from the electric mass which over-hung
the entire region. When it was no longer
possible to pursue her occupation, for want of
light, she crossed her arms, and remained seated
on her threshold. It was not that she watched
for the flitting forth of the bat; nor to see the
gaudier winged creatures of the wood nestle in
the brakes; nor to see the moonbeams piercing a
way for themselves through the curtain of foliage
till they kissed the modest lotus that slept on the
bosom of the water; nor to mark the vigilant
stars resume their watch, rising, some like mute
sentinels, others in full constellation like trained
bands, to look down from their blue height upon
all that moved and breathed below. There was
no visible kindling of golden fires in the firmament
this night; no winging home of a belated
bird; and the water-lilies were left to themselves.
It was to watch for some opening in the clouds
which might let down air and light, that Marana
still sat abroad. She felt half stifled with heat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.67'>67</span>and with a vague fear, and dreaded kindling a
light, and closing the entrance for the night.—Rayo
was still behind the dwelling, tying up
bunches of cocoa-nut leaves to burn, and splitting
resinous woods into torches. When the
twilight expired, he was there. When the black
darkness had descended a full hour, he was lighting
himself through the wood with one of his
new torches.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is time to close the door against the panther,”
said he to Marana, before he set forth.
“Spread the mat and sleep, when you have
prayed to St. Anthony for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you? will you not kneel to pray on
the same mat?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have a prayer to say some way off which
no one may overhear. So go in, and trust to
my returning,—before day-break, if not in darkness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, do not bring any more curses, Rayo, by
taking what is not ours. Here is money to buy
grain in the harbour, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Money!” exclaimed Rayo. “Your friend
Amoottra must have brought you money. Does
it not taint your fingers with leprosy, Marana?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She let the money fall in a fit of horror; but
when her husband laughed a laugh which must
have been highly offensive to any hag who
might happen to be within hearing, Marana
conjured him to do nothing to remind the foe of
her expecting victim. Rayo had superstition
enough in him to induce him to take the hint,
though not sufficient to prevent his searching for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.68'>68</span>the dropped money by the light of his torch, and
being very glad to pick it up from the brown,
crumbling turf where it had fallen. In vain
Marana entreated to be permitted to carry the
torch for her husband. In vain she urged the
desirableness of her being at hand to sing the
“Hail!” to the first burst of the season’s thunder.
She was commanded to pray and sleep,
and dream of the verdure which might possibly
have overspread the rice-fields before the morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>She ventured, however, to steal out on the
track of Rayo’s footsteps. The risk of falling in
with a leopard or a tiger-cat while she carried no
torch was nothing in comparison with the uncertainty
as to what was being done or undergone
by her husband. She had been his companion
on the raft one night, and in his flight through
the woods on another; and now he went out
alone, and in silence as to his object. She feared
that this reserve argued something more than
care for her health; some desperation of design
too great to be confided even to her. She blamed
herself for all. Some immediate misfortune was,
she believed, to follow her impious act of the
morning; and all her husband’s sins, from his
withdrawal of confidence from her, to whatever
act he might be now about to perpetrate, must
be answered for by her. She went out to watch,
as an unpractised magician may be supposed to
await the results of his first spell, in a state of
expectation made wretched by horror and fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>She followed Rayo’s steps at such a distance
that she could not herself have been perceived, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.69'>69</span>he had chanced to look behind him; but the
torch which he carried before him marked the
outlines of his figure very distinctly, as the light
was reflected from the roof of foliage upon his
anointed limbs, from which nearly the last remains
of his garments were dropping in rags.
When he emerged from the shade, on reaching
the ditch which surrounded the cinnamon garden,
he slackened his pace, as if meditating the method
by which he might go straightest to some fixed
point which he had in his eye. He turned to the
left. Marana turned to the left likewise, keeping
under the shadow of the wood. He stopped,
and looked up to the sky. She could not so
raise her eyes, for the heavens at that moment
opened, and let out a flood of lightning, from
which a self-condemned person like herself could
not but shrink. Again and again came the
lightning, sustaining the awful alternation by
which the landscape appeared one moment wrapt
in midnight darkness, and the next in noon-day
glare. Crashing thunder then came, peal upon
peal, driving her from her perilous station under
the trees to a more open part of the jungle,
where she stood fearfully glancing about her in
a sort of expectation that every object within
sight would rise up against her, and come crowding
about her; for the thunder was enough to
waken the dead, and no suspicion crossed her
mind that this storm was not especially directed
against herself. Rayo’s operations did not seem
to be impeded by it. He had crossed the ditch
while Marana had covered her eyes, and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.70'>70</span>intervals of the lightning, the dancing spark of
his torch might be seen wandering, like a will-o’-the-wisp,
at a greater and a greater distance.
It was not long before it became evident to his
wife whither and for what purpose he was gone.
Little puffs of dun smoke arose, like fire-balloons,
from behind the dark-leaved shrubbery which he
had entered. A delicious scent pervaded the
region as the fire spread, like airs from heaven
finding their way among blasts from hell. It
was plain that Rayo was setting fire to the bark
which was in course of being harvested.</p>

<p class='c001'>What might be his fate if he fell into the
hands of the challias, Marana dared not think.
If he could but creep away under the bushes,
and leave it to be supposed that lightning had
been the agent of mischief, she could rejoice as
heartily as he in the discomfiture of the presumptuous
challias, and the loss suffered by the
strangers who, under the pretence of protection,
were perpetually employed in rifling the land of
its treasures, and depressing the condition of the
natural owners of those treasures. She would
have rejoiced to see every twig in this vast garden
consumed, if such destruction could avail to
drive away the Honourable Company who, by
right of purchase, interfered to limit the production,
restrict the commerce, and therefore impoverish
the condition of those from whom they
derived their wealth. If this Company could but
be driven from its monopoly, so that every man
might plant cinnamon in his garden, and sit
under its shadow with none to make him afraid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.71'>71</span>he who this night carried the fire-brand might
be set up for worship on a higher eminence (if
such could be found) than Adam’s Peak, and be
feasted and garlanded daily, instead of, like the
holy Footmark, once a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>What Rayo’s fate was it was impossible to
conjecture, all watching and listening being now
baffled by the commotion of the storm. Smoke
arose after awhile in a second place, then in a
third, thus marking the progress of the incendiary.
There were only a few spikes of clear
flame visible. Each heap of bark must be presently
consumed, and the shrubs were too moist
to be in danger of more than a singeing from the
fire. The most obvious thing to the anxious
wife was to follow her husband; and more than
once she attempted to move: but, at first, her
wasted limbs failed her, and then she thought
she perceived tokens of an approaching earthquake.
A wind like this had often, in her recollection,
brought down some massy distant tree,
whose fall shook the ground for many a rood;
but now, either many such trees were falling, or
some other cause prolonged the vibration. She expected
an earthquake, during which the hag
would arise, or she herself be swallowed up by
some chasm that would open beneath her feet.
Suddenly the shaking ceased, and a flash disclosed
to her a horrible vision at hand which
explained all. Fiery eyes blazed, and white
tusks gleamed over the tallest of the shrubs
which grew to the left of the place where she
stood. She had just seen the twisting of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.72'>72</span>lithe trunk which could carry her up twenty feet
in an instant, and she now heard the snuffing
and snorting before which every living thing
within many furlongs must be quaking like herself.
She felt before the elephant like a worm in
the path of a cruel schoolboy,—as certain that
the ponderous tread would be directed to crush
her; and when the next gleam showed the bulky
head and shoulders of this moving mass veering
round to face her, she could only pray that she
might be annihilated by one tread, instead of
being made fatal sport of high in the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo proved her unintentional deliverer. The
fire he had kindled did not catch the green
shrubs; but some flakes were carried off by the
wind, and fell among the parched grass near the
outskirts of the plantation. There were in an
instant rivulets of fire running beneath the
stems, joining and parting, according to the
quantity of fuel which lay in their way. Every
morsel of oily bark casually dropped the day
before, now sent up its tiny jet of blue flame;
the dried twigs snapped and kindled, and the
gleaming ditch was the boundary-line between
the darkness and the light. This fire was as unwelcome
to the wild elephant beyond its reach
as to the burnished snakes that came wriggling
out into the blaze as their holes grew too hot to
hold them. He turned short round with a troubled
cry, and distanced the scene at his quickest
trot, wakening the birds as he brushed their
covert in his passage, and leaving far behind the
scared elk that burst a way among the stems,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.73'>73</span>and the hyænas that hushed their cry and
skulked in the thickets. To the mind of a Cingalese,
the elephant of Ceylon is the most majestic
of all animals, the elephants of all other
countries being reported to acknowledge its
supremacy by a salam; but this emperor of the
beasts was now put to flight by the same means
that made the gazelle palpitate in its hiding
place among the grass.</p>

<p class='c001'>The alarm was soon at an end. The canopy
of clouds descended, lower and lower, till there
seemed small breathing space left between them
and the earth, and then burst, quenching the
lightning and the flame at once, drowning the
thunder, and threatening to plunge the island in
the sea. When the sheet of water had descended
for a while, the ditch overflowed, the
snakes raised themselves on end, the waters
found their way into the lair of every couchant
beast, and dripped from the plumage of every
bird on its perch. To wade through the jungle
in this pitchy darkness immediately after the
dazzling apparition of the cinnamon garden had
vanished, was impossible. Marana remained
clinging to a tree, the creepers from which
dangled wet in her face, till she heard the sound
of a quiet laugh through the flash and downpour.
“Here is the hag, at last,” thought she,
expecting to feel the loathsome touch which she
was persuaded she must encounter sooner or
later. Her agonized cry for mercy produced
another laugh, but a kindly one. It was from
her husband.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.74'>74</span>“Rayo! what a storm!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“St. Anthony rides the monsoon this year,”
replied Rayo. “Do you know what the lightning
has done in the garden? The Company
have been praying for the monsoon for their
neighbours’ sake. In the morning you will hear
how they complain of it for their own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Was it all the storm, Rayo?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They will tell you so in the morning. Come
home now. I will take you by a path where the
waters cannot beat you down like the dragon-fly,
nor carry you away like the squirrel that is
caught far from its hole. But I forbade your
coming abroad. You were afraid to await the
hag under a roof, I suppose. If she must come,
I wish it might be in the morning. She would
see in the garden that which would make her so
merry that she would forget you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Can you say your prayers to keep off the
curse to-night, Rayo? Dare you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, yes; and quickly, that I may sleep, and
be early ready to see the Challias collect in the
garden.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the morning, before Marana’s long ague-fit
had given place to sleep, her husband was on
the spot of the late cinnamon harvest. The sky
was not clear of clouds, large masses still being
in act of rising from the east; but a mild sunshine
burnished the scene; the rose-coloured
peaks of the distant mountains,—the fresh-springing
verdure of the fields which were so lately
brown,—and the multitudes of winged creatures
that flitted, hovered, and sailed in the balmy air.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.75'>75</span>All was as fair in the interval of the storms as if
no storm had ever been. It was much more
<a id='corr75.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the faces'>wonderful</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_75.3'><ins class='correction'>wonderful</ins></a></span> to Rayo to see no signs of storm in
<a id='corr75.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wonderful'>the faces</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_75.4'><ins class='correction'>the faces</ins></a></span> of those who were most concerned in
the loss of the cinnamon. Mr. Carr looked not
only free from anger towards the lightning to
which he attributed the destruction, but satisfied
and pleased at the existing state of things.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The lightning has saved the Company from
the curses of the people,” he heard Captain
Cinnamon whisper to a modelier of the garden.
“There was too good a crop this year; and if
some of it must be burned, it was very well that
accident should do it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And that accident should have burned more
than the Company would have dared to destroy in
the face of the natives. Now they may put their
own price upon their bark; and a pretty price it
will be, to judge by Mr. Carr’s pleased face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not that he wishes ill to the natives, or to
the eaters of cinnamon in other lands. But he
is thinking of the good news he has to send to
his employers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rayo rolled himself in the sand when he thus
learned what was the result of his enterprise.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>If the drought had been confined to the western
coast of Ceylon, its effects would have been very
deplorable, from the poverty of the people,
though, from their being in the habit of the
regular importation of rice, they were more sure
of some extent of supply than if they had been
dependent on their own scanty crops. But this
year, the drought extended to some of the districts
of the neighbouring country, from which
rice was annually imported to a large amount.
This again, would have mattered little, if the inhabitants
had had the means of purchasing from
a greater distance; but these means could not be
within the reach of a colony whose productions
were monopolized by the mother country. Hundreds
of thousands of the inhabitants of Ceylon
who, if allowed the usual inducements to an
accumulation of capital, would have been in
common times purchasers of the innumerable
comforts which the world yields, and in the
worst seasons placed far above the reach of want,
were reduced by a single delay of the monsoon
to such a condition as rendered it doubtful
whether they would ever be purchasers of anything.
Again, want of capital was the grievance
from which all other temporal grievances arose
in this region of natural wealth and super-abundant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.77'>77</span>beauty; and this want of capital was
caused by the diversion of labour from its natural
channels, through the interference of the evil
spirit of monopoly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Streams ran down from the mountains; and
on either side of the streams were levels which
lay waste and bare for want of irrigation; and on
the banks of these streams lived a population
which subsisted on unwholesome and unseasoned
or deficient food. These waters could not be
made useful, these plains could not be fertilized,
these people could not be fed, because the natural
wealth of the country was not permitted to
create capital to the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cotton-tree might be met with growing
luxuriantly wherever the hand of man or of
nature had caused it to take root; yet those who
lived within reach of its boughs hid themselves
in the woods for the scantiness of their clothing,
or went without some other necessary, in order
to furnish themselves expensively with cotton-cloth
which had been woven four thousand miles
off. That it should be woven where it was, and
sold where it was, was well; but that the purchasers
should not have the raw materials to exchange
for the wrought, or something else to
offer which should not leave them destitute,
spoke ill for the administrators of their affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Potters’ clay abounded in the intervals between
soils which offered something better; and here
and there a rude workman was seen “working
his work on the wheel,” as in the days of
Jeremiah the prophet, and marring the clay, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.78'>78</span>making another vessel, as it seemed good to the
potter. It would have seemed good to him to
make better vessels, to improve his craft, and
bring up his children to the art, and supply
households at greater distance with utensils, and
get wealth and contentment, but that he had no
money to spend on improvements, and that if
his children tried to get any, they could find no
free scope for their enterprize.</p>

<p class='c001'>Herds of buffaloes were seen feeding amidst
the rank vegetation of the hills, and many a
peasant would have gone among them, morning
and evening, with his bottle of hide slung over
his shoulder; and many a maiden with her vase
poised upon her head, if a free commerce in
ghee had been permitted with the Arabs who
must drink a cupfull of it every morning, and
with the multitude of dwellers in the Eastern
Archipelago, who want it for anointings, for
food, for sacrifice, and other purposes which now
cost them dear. But the buffaloes might graze
in peace, the peasants being permitted to sell
ghee only to those who could not buy, or who
did not consume ghee.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were cocoa-nut fibres enough to spin a
coir rope which might measure the equator; but
coir was so taxed, as soon as it became rope, that
the government need have little fear that any
one would buy but itself and those who could get
no cheaper cordage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chay-root, yielding the red dye which figures
on Indian chintzes, spread itself far and wide
through the light dry soil near the coast. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.79'>79</span>it should hurt the British government that all
nations should have red roses on their chintzes
had not been satisfactorily explained; but it was
the will of that government that few should do
so. The government bought up every ounce of
chay-root which its Cingalese subjects were
obliging enough to sell. There was much loyalty
in thus furnishing chay-root; the diggers being
paid a good deal less than half the price which
the government demanded from its purchasers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fragrance of spices was borne on every
breeze; shells of various beautiful forms were
thrown up by every tide; tortoiseshell might be
had for the trouble of polishing, and ivory for
that of hunting the elephant; arrack flowed for
any one who would set it running from the tree;
canes to make matting and baskets were trodden
down from their abundance; the topaz and the
amethyst, the opal, the garnet, the ruby, and the
sapphire, jet, crystal, and pearls, were strewed
as in fairy-land; the jack-wood, rivalling the
finest mahogany, ebony, satin-wood, and the
finely-veined calaminda, grew like thorns in the
thicket; yet the natural proprietors of this
wealth, to which the world looked with longing
eyes, were half-fed and not clothed; and their
English fellow-subjects, located in a far less
favourable habitation, were taxed to afford them
such meagre support as they had.</p>

<p class='c001'>The world had rolled back with the Cingalese.
Monuments were before them at every step,
which showed that their country had been more
populous than now, and their forefathers more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.80'>80</span>prosperous than themselves. They were now too
many for their food—too many for the labour
which their rulers vouchsafed to call for; yet
they were but a million and a half on a territory
which had sustained in more comfort a much
greater number, without taxing a distant nation
to give unproductive aid to a puny people, and
before the advantages of national interchange
had been fully ascertained. There were traces of
times, before the English artizan was called
upon to contribute his mite to his tawny brother
over the sea; before the government complained
of the expense of its colony; before murmurs
arose about the scanty supply of cinnamon, while
the Honourable Company was claiming compensation
for an over-supply; before the rulers
at Columbo began to be at their wit’s end to find
means for keeping up their credit; before the
expenditure of the colony so far exceeded its
revenue, as that the inquiry began among certain
wise ones, where was the great advantage of
having a colony which, however rich in name
and appearance, cost more than it produced:
there were traces of happier times, when the
world seemed to have been wiser, however
younger, than at present; or when the Cingalese
had been under a wiser sway than that which
was now calling upon them for perpetual submission
and gratitude. The Dutch might have
been hard task-masters; but it was now felt that
the English were yet more so; and however
much submission might be yielded, because it
could not be refused, there was small room for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.81'>81</span>gratitude, as any one would have admitted who
could have drawn an accurate comparison between
the condition of the foreign and the
native, the producing and the commercial, population
of the western portion of the island during
this season of hardship.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Dutch-built houses, inhabited by foreign
agents, displayed all their usual luxuries; carpeted
with fragrant mats, gemmed with precious
stones, perfumed with spicy oils, and supplied
with food and drinks purchased by native produce
from foreign lands. The huts of their
humbler neighbours, meanwhile, were bare alike
of furniture and food, and, for the most part,
empty of inhabitants. The natives of eastern
countries seem to find consolation in the open air
in times of extreme hardship; not only laying
their sick on the banks of rivers, but gathering
together in hungry groups by the road-side or by
the sea-shore, in times of famine, gazing patiently
on the food which is carried before their eyes,
and waiting for death as the sun goes down.
Such were the groups now seen on the shores of
the Lake of Columbo, and in many an open
space among the spoiled paddy-fields, while the
foreigners, from whom they were wont to receive
their pittance, were engaged with their curries,
their coffee, and their meats from many climes.
Thus was it during the day; while at night the
distribution of action was reversed. The foreigners
slept at ease in their cooled and darkened
apartments, or, if they could not rest, had nothing
worse to complain of than a mosquito foe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.82'>82</span>while their native neighbours were silently forming
funeral piles along the shore; silently bringing
more wood and more from the thickets, as
others of their caste dropped dead at length;
silently laying out the corpses; silently watching
them as they turned to ashes, and placing the
limbs decently as they fell asunder; silently
ranging themselves so that the funeral fire played
in their dark eyes, and shone on their worn
and lanky frames; silently waiting till the morning
breeze puffed out the last flickering flame,
and dispersed the handful of white ashes, which
was all that remained of the parent who had
murmured his blessing at sunset, or the wife
who had whispered her farewell at midnight, or
the infant whose breath had parted at the summons
of the dawn. Silently were these rites
performed; insomuch that any chance-watcher
in the neighbouring verandah heard no other interruption
to the splash of waters than the crackling
of flames, and would not have guessed that
bands of patient sufferers were gathered round
this fearful sacrifice to the evil spirit of monopoly—a
sacrifice as far from appeasing the
demon as from testifying to the willing homage
of his priests. There were not among the gentle
Cingalese any of the fierce passions which this
demon commonly delights to unleash among his
victims; none of the envy, jealousy, and hatred
with which the desperately miserable enhance
their desperation and their misery. Instead of
jostling one another, these sufferers sat side by
side; instead of gnashing their teeth at each
other, they were altogether heedless of neighbourhood;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.83'>83</span>instead of inflicting injuries, they
merely ceased to confer mutual benefits. No
aged man complained of violence, but sank
down disappointed, when he found the water-pot—placed
for the traveller’s refreshment—empty
by the wayside. No wearied woman murmured
at being dislodged from the sheltered bench on
the bridge; but neither did those, who had
niched themselves there to seek forgetfulness in
sleep, stir to make way for a fellow-sufferer. No
child was driven from its chance meal by a
stronger arm than its own; but neither was
there a look or a word to spare for the little
ones (more tenacious of life than their parents),
who crept from their dead mother to their dying
father, trying in vain to suck life from the
shrunken breasts of the one, and to unclose the
fixed eyes of the other. Some who remained in
their habitations in the woods, if less destitute,
were not less miserable. If the sight and scent of
the bread-fruit were too strong for the fortitude
of some, they ate under the full conviction that
they were exchanging famine for leprosy. Whether
the belief in this effect of the fruit was right
or wrong, those who believed and yet ate suffered
cruelly for the want of rice. If a follower
of Brama, in passing a ruin, saw a cow browsing
on some pinnacle, and, in a fit of desperation,
called the sacred creature down to be made food
of, he found himself gnawed by the consciousness
of his inexpiable crime, as fearfully as by
his previous hunger. An ample importation of
rice—such as might always be secured by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.84'>84</span>absence of restrictions on commerce—would
have saved to these the pangs of conscience, till
a better knowledge had had time to strike root
and ripen for harvest, as it would have spared to
others the agonies of hunger while their rice-grounds
were awaiting the latter rains, and preparing
to become fruitful again in their season.
As it was, all were prevented making the most
of their own soil from want of capital; and,
while rendered dependent on the importation of
grain, were denied the means of insuring that
importation. By the exorbitant taxation of some
of their articles of produce, and the prohibition
to sell others to any buyer but the government,
the Cingalese were deprived of all chance of securing
a subsistence, and of all inducement to
accumulate property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Carr did not know that she had ever
enjoyed her way of life more, on the whole, than
since she had come to Ceylon. She liked lying
down for the greater part of the day, and being
sure of seeing something beautiful from the verandah
when she could exert herself to look
abroad from it. She liked being fanned by the
punkah, and waited upon by five times as many
servants as she wanted, and amused by Alice, and
flattered by her husband’s station; none of the
trouble of which devolved upon her. But she
did not know whether some friends of hers liked
the place so well; she thought not, by Mr.
Serle’s grave manner, and the new expression of
fear and anxiety in Mrs. Serle’s open and happy
countenance. Mr. and Mrs. Serle were American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.85'>85</span>missionaries; members of the little band of
philanthropists who, setting the example of charity
towards their Cingalese brethren, were met
and cheered by the open hand of charity at
every turn, till they were fairly established in the
society and in the hearts of those whom they
came to civilize and bless.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am glad you did not ask our advice about
coming,” observed Mrs. Carr to the missionary’s
wife: “we find it very pleasant in Ceylon; but
I do not know whether you find it as pleasant
as we do; and it would have been a disagreeable
thing to have misled you. I am glad you
did not ask our advice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mrs. Serle comes to lead such a different kind
of life from yours, my dear,” observed her husband,
“that any advice from you could have
helped her little. You see and enjoy all the
natural advantages of the place, which are very
great indeed: Mrs. Serle comes to do what she
can towards remedying the misery of the people,
which is quite as remarkable in its way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I beg to say that I enjoy the natural
advantages of the place,” replied Mrs. Serle; “I
like your Adam’s Peak at sunrise, and your gay
insects, and your flowery jungle, and your pine-apples
as well as any of you. I do not wish to
be the less sensible of these things because the
people claim my compassion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not the less, but rather the more,” observed
her husband, “that the misery of the people
may be the more quickly remedied. When we
find starving men in a paradise, our next business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.86'>86</span>is to find out whose fault it is that they are
starving.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are the laziest people here,” drawled
Mrs. Carr; “you will hardly believe till you
have been here as long as we have——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear love,” interrupted her husband,
“Mr. and Mrs. Serle have seen far more of the
people already than you can pretend to know,
living within doors as you do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, but I assure you, I can tell Mrs. Serle
such things as she will scarcely believe. The
laziness of the people is really such as to make
me wonder. Alice, love, come and tie my sandal.
O, thank you, Mrs. Serle. I did not mean to
trouble you, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Serle did not need convincing as to the
indolence of the Cingalese. It was quite as evident
in them as in Mrs. Carr. Neither was she
much in the dark as to the causes of this indolence.
The probability of a remedy was the
almost hourly subject of conversation between
her husband and herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are very much wanted, you see,” observed
Mrs. Carr; “I am sure it is a most happy
thing for the poor people of this country that so
many strangers come to see them and do them
good. So many Dutch, formerly; and now so
many English; and you and your friends from
America.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope you think the obligation mutual, my
dear?” said her husband; “You must not forget
how many Dutch and English have made their
fortunes here. I say nothing about the Americans;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.87'>87</span>for our friends here have a very different
object, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, it is an advantage to both parties, no
doubt,” observed the lady; “I should never have
had such an amethyst as this, in my cross, if
Ceylon had not belonged to us, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I should only have been like any other
young lady, instead of having seven servants
when I go out,” remarked Alice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And our friend Belton would not have had
that beautiful place of his at South Point to live
in,” added Mr. Carr: “yet I hear complaints—terrible
complaints—from the Company, about
their losses in the cinnamon trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I from some members of your government,
about the expense of the colony,” said
Mr. Serle. “Now, if the people are acknowledged
to be in a low state, if the government
complains of the expense of the settlement, and
if the Honourable Company cannot always
make its cinnamon trade answer, who gains by
Ceylon being a colony?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is usually supposed to be an advantage to
an uncivilized country to be chosen for a settlement
by a civilized set of people,” replied Mr.
Carr.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I have no doubt that it is so, any more
than I doubt the advantage to the civilized country
of having some foreign half-peopled region
to which her sons may repair, to struggle, not
in vain, for a subsistence. I can never doubt
the policy of persons of different countries agreeing
to dwell together in one, that they may yield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.88'>88</span>mutual assistance by the communication of their
respective possessions and qualifications. If this
assistance be yielded in a spirit of freedom, without
any tyrannical exercise of the right of the
strongest at the outset, this intercourse is sure to
grow into a mutual and general blessing of incalculable
value. If abused, by the sacrifice of the
many to the supposed gain of the few, the connexion
becomes an inestimable curse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To the natives, certainly,” replied Mr. Carr.
“We may observe that the prosperity of colonized
countries is not to be measured by circumstances
of climate, natural fertility, position, and
so on, but by the policy pursued in their government.
In the dreariest parts of our American colonies,
for instance——I do not know whether
you are acquainted with Canada?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am; and with Nova Scotia likewise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; in no part of those colonies are the
natural wealth and beauty to be met with which
distinguish Ceylon; and in no part, I hope, are
the labouring inhabitants to be found in so
wretched a state as are too many here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nowhere; and I do not see that the circumstance
of the labourers here being partly natives,
and the rest, races long settled in the country,
makes any difference in the estimate, while it is
certain that they are affected by the common
motives to industry and social improvement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The people here are open to such motives.
Witness the growing ambition of the cinnamon
peelers, in proportion as their services are in
request, and are rewarded with regularity. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.89'>89</span>Challias hold up their heads now, and dispute
precedence with other castes; and so would other
labouring castes, if they had encouragement to
do any better than crouch beneath the cocoa-nut
tree, live upon what it may yield, and die
when it yields no more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Nova Scotian is a far more prosperous
man than either the native or the settler of Ceylon,
though the Nova Scotian is not yet so
happy as a perfectly wise government would
allow him scope to become. He is not, like our
neighbours here, prevented from selling one kind
of produce where he pleases, while he is discouraged
in the preparation of another kind by
excessive taxation. The Nova Scotian can prepare
his fish, and carry it where he likes for sale.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How rejoiced would our people be to have
the same liberty with their pearls and their
spice!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes: but the Nova Scotian has his trammels
too, though they are far less grievous. He
envies his neighbours of my country,—of the
United States, as much as the Cingalese may
envy him. When he has sold his fish in the
wide market which the Brazils afford, he may
not take in exchange any Brazilian article that
will be most wanted in Nova Scotia. There are
many Brazilian commodities which your government
will not allow its American colonies to purchase;
so that its Nova Scotian subject must
return with something of less value, or go home
by a round-about way, exchanging and exchanging,
till he finds an article that he may lawfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.90'>90</span>carry. My countryman, meantime, makes the
best of his way home with a cargo of something
that Brazil wants to sell and the States are ready
to buy. This freedom from impediment in his
traffic gives him the advantage over the Nova
Scotian, as the comparative freedom of the Nova
Scotian does over the Cingalese.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And this countryman of yours, or his father,
was a fellow-subject of mine. Truly, he seems
better off than when we were under the same
king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how is your country the worse for his
being no longer your fellow-subject,—for his
country being no longer a British colony? Do
you buy and sell less of each other? Do you
steal one another’s trade? Does not America
rather deal the more largely with you, the wider
and more rapid is her traffic with the rest of the
world?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your argument would go to prove that we
should be better without colonies; but what will
our merchants say to our parting with markets
into which we can empty our warehouses?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to being better without colonies,—we
agreed just now that colonies are good things
both for the natives and the settlers, while the
one class wants to be civilized and the other to
find a home of promise. Let this connexion be
modified by circumstances as time rolls on, the
child growing up into a state fit for self-government,
and the mother country granting the liberty
of self-government as the fitness increases. If
the control be continued too long, if the colony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.91'>91</span>be not admitted to understand, and allowed to
pursue its own interests, its interests must languish,
and it will become a proportionate burden
to the mother country. It will have only the
wages of ill-paid labour, or the scanty profits of
feeble speculation to exchange for the productions
of the mother country, instead of a store of
wealth gathered by commerce with the whole world.
Which is worth the most to England at this moment,
Ceylon, her servile dependency, or any
province of her band of commercial allies,—our
United States,—I leave your merchants to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true, we get nothing now in taxes from
your States; but we get incalculably more as the
profits of trade; while the heavy taxation of
Ceylon will not nearly pay its own expenses, and
the mother country must defray the remainder.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So much for keeping colonies for the sake of
their trade. This notion involves two assumptions;
that the colony would not trade with the
mother country if it were no longer a colony,
and that colonial monopoly is a good to the
mother country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The very term ‘colony trade’ involves the
notion of monopoly: since, if there were no monopoly,
the distinction would be lost between that
and any other sort of free trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; if the exclusive trade with the mother
country be the best for the interest of the colony,
the colony will continue it, after the compulsion
is withdrawn. If it be not for the interest of the
colony, neither can it be so for the parent; since
the interest of the seller demands the prosperity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.92'>92</span>of the customer; and the welfare of the whole
demands the welfare of its component parts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, our colonies are too often used as a
special instrument of forcing the means of production
into artificial channels, to serve the selfish
purposes of classes, or companies, or individuals.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thereby ruining the interests of these self-same
classes, companies, and individuals. If any
class of merchants can succeed in making themselves
the only buyers of any article from a
colony, or the only sellers of any article in it,
they may for a time dictate their own terms to
their slaves: but not for long. They may stock
the market at home with precious things
which they get as cheap as stones and straws in
the colony; but their mutual competition will
soon bring down the price to the common rate of
profit. And if not,—if the merchants agree upon
a price and keep to it, the colony will not long
fulfil its part in this unequal bargain. A losing
bargain must come to an end sooner or later;
and labour being discouraged, and capital absorbed
in the colony, the merchants will inevitably
find their supplies fall short.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was going to ask,” observed Mrs. Serle,
“why the colony need act in such a bargain? If
it had any spirit, it would refuse to traffic.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Its power to do so depends on the nature of
its supplies from the <a id='corr92.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mother country'>mother-country</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_92.29'><ins class='correction'>mother-country</ins></a></span>. If it derives
only luxuries, it may resist oppression by
declining to receive the luxuries of the mother-country,
and it may defy oppression by devising
luxuries for itself. In these cases, the mother-country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.93'>93</span>sustains a pure loss of the trade. If the
colony is dependent for necessaries, it can defy
the oppressor no further than by using the
smallest possible quantity. Few people discern
much value in the trade of a country whose population
barely lives. Such a commerce will not
repay the trouble of maintaining a monopoly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It does seem to me, certainly, that if any
compulsion is used at all, it should be to oblige
the colony to sell to none but the parent. If it
can buy cheaper elsewhere, so much is saved of
the resources of the empire. It would be a loss to
the British empire to have Ceylon buy its wine
from London alone, if wine might be obtained
cheaper from Madeira. The extra price which
the carriage and the profits of the middlemen
would demand, would be just so much withdrawn
from the customer’s means of production and of
future purchase.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the case is no better when the prohibition
regards selling from the colony. If the colonial
article produces just the ordinary profits of
stock, the purchasing country takes needless trouble
in enforcing the monopoly. If less than the ordinary
profits of stock, the article will cease to be
produced. If more, the purchaser may feel perfectly
secure of being thanked for her custom,
instead of its being necessary to intrude it by
force of law. All this applies as well to a trade-driving
government, or an exclusive company,
as to a general body of merchants; the only difference
being that such a government or company,
having a more despotic power by the absence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.94'>94</span>of competition, the tyranny may be consummated
sooner, and the mischief wrought more
effectually. Your government keeps its pearl-fishers,
and your Honourable Company its spice-gatherers,
impoverished more effectually than a
general body of British pearl and spice merchants
could have done.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet the general body of merchants can carry
on the work of impoverishment with tolerable
vigour and success, even upon a dependency so
near at hand as to have great facilities for remonstrance.
In the case of Ireland, towards the
close of the last century, they contrived to rivet
the chains of monopoly for a few years longer,
after having done wonders in beggaring the
Green Island.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They were helped by the country gentlemen
there, my dear,” replied Mrs. Serle, who was an
English woman, “and by the manufacturers
and shipowners and others. I remember how
my grandfather used to talk after dinner about
the ruin which would come upon us all if the Irish,—with
their low wages and light taxation, were
allowed to get their own sugar from the West
Indies, and to pay for it with some articles of
their own produce. And my uncle Joe and the
curate used to agree that we were quite kind
enough already to Ireland in giving her permission
from year to year to send beef and butter to
our colonies, and to clothe her own troops, then
serving in America, with her own manufactures.
The squire and the clergyman and the shopkeeper
in the next village got up a petition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.95'>95</span>parliament against letting the Irish have any
more trade, lest they should spoil ours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And Liverpool expected to dwindle into a
fishing village again, and Manchester that her
deserted factories would become the abode of the
owl and the bat; and Glasgow pleaded an hereditary
right to the sugar trade which Ireland must
not be permitted to invade. Where this right
came from it was for Glasgow to say; but, in
enforcing it, Glasgow seemed much tempted to
sink audacious Ireland into the sea. It is a pity,
my dear, that your grandfather did not live to see
Liverpool at the present day, after ten times as
much having been granted to Ireland as was then
asked for. In proportion as the commerce between
England and Ireland has grown into the
similitude of a coasting trade, the prosperity of
Liverpool and many another English town has
increased, while the resources of Ireland (however
deplorably cramped by bad government to
this day) have steadily though slowly improved.
The same fears, the same opposition, were excited,
I think, Mr. Carr, when a relaxation was
proposed in some departments of your Company’s
monopoly, and with the same results.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. There was an idea, some time ago,
that nothing remained to be done in the way
of traffic with India. It was thought that the
private trader could find no new channels of commerce,
and that India could not benefit in any
way by a change.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Can anything equal the presumption of human
decisions on untried matters!” cried Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.96'>96</span>Serle. “Did your Company really amply supply
the whole of India with all that Hindoo hearts
and Mahomedan minds could desire? Was
nothing more wanted by a people who died by
thousands in a year for want of salt; who fell
sick by hundreds of thousands for want of clothing,
habitations, and the wholesome arts of life,
and who groaned by millions under privation
and excessive toil? If your Company thus reported
itself the faithful and wise steward, giving
to the people under him meat in their season, I,
for one, would have besought, in that day as in
this, to have him cast out. His weeping and
gnashing of teeth would have been unheard
amidst the shout of joy when the door closed behind
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, but he was not cast out,” said Mrs.
Serle. “He was only compelled to relax his
rule. Was there any rejoicing?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Much, very much, my dear. The direct
commerce between England and India has
already been more than doubled. Private traders
have proved that there were still desirable articles
that India had not, and that more and more
became invented and wished for in proportion
as people are allowed to minister to each other.
I question whether any man will be again found
between this and doomsday to say that India
cannot want any thing more, and that there is
nothing left for anybody out of the Honourable
Company to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The persuasion arose,” observed Mr. Carr,
“from the character of the people,—their wants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.97'>97</span>being so simple and few, their domestic habits
and pursuits so uniform, and their resort to the
productions of their own country so invariable,
that they did not seem to need anything that
foreigners could give.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shut an infant into a dungeon, and bring
him out when he is twenty,” said Mrs. Serle,
“and, if he has never tasted anything but bread
and water, he will want no other food than bread
and water. If his dress has always been sacking,
his ignorant choice will be of sacking still,
though broadcloth be lying beside it. But have
patience with him till he has tasted beef and
wine, and seen every other man of twenty dressed
in broadcloth, and by the time he is thirty, we
shall hear no more of his simple tastes, and of
his resort to primitive productions. Our ancestors,
Mr. Carr, had a very simple taste for acorns
of native growth: they resorted to native productions,—wolf-skins,—for
clothing; their pursuits
were uniform enough,—picking up acorns
and hunting wolves;—they gathered round their
murderous wicker deity, as the Hindoos round
the pile of the suttee; and the one people venerated
the mistletoe as the other glorifies cow-dung:
nevertheless, here are we at this day, you
dressed in broadcloth, and I in silk, and both of
us philosophizing on civilization. Why should
it not be the same with the Hindoo in due time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And before so many hundred years as it
took to civilize the Britons,” observed Mr. Carr.
“The exports from Great Britain to the countries
east of the Cape have quadrupled since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.98'>98</span>relaxation of the monopoly; and the difficulty
now is for traders with India to find returns for
the variety of goods demanded by India. Formerly,
England paid in gold and silver; now we
pay in iron, copper, and steel, in woollens and
cottons, and in a hundred other articles, of which
few Hindoos dreamed a century ago. India
sends back indigo,—the best of a very few
articles which may be imported into Great
Britain by individuals. Whenever the day shall
arrive for the Company’s monopoly of China to
be abolished, tea, mother-of-pearl, and nankeens,
will afford a larger variety, India will make a
new start in the career of civilization, and Great
Britain a mighty acquisition in her foreign commercial
relations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In all the cases you have mentioned,” observed
Mrs. Serle, “the restrictions have been
imposed with a view to the welfare of the mother-country,
and at the expense of the colony. Are
there not cases of a reverse policy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many; but here, as in many cases, the
reverse of wrong is not right. Whether it be
attempted to enrich the parent at the expense of
the child, or the child at the expense of the parent,
a great folly is perpetrated, if, by letting both
alone, they might enrich each other. Perhaps
the most flagrant instance of this kind of impolicy
is the management of the British timber trade.
Your government, Mr. Carr, loads Norwegian
timber with excessive duties, that the inferior
timber of Canada may have the preference in the
market. By this means, not only is Norway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.99'>99</span>deprived of its just right of priority, and Britain
of a useful customer, but Canada is tempted to
neglect some very important processes of improvement
for the sake of——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of pushing the lumber trade,” interrupted
Mr. Carr. “I am aware that the Canadians
carry their felling, squaring, and floating of
timber a great deal too far, to the injury of agriculture,
and of the condition of the people in
every way. I am aware that any depression of
this artificial timber-trade, however felt by individuals,
is a decided gain to the colony at large.
Great Britain has, in that instance, made a sacrifice
in a wrong place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what a sacrifice! If no partiality were
shown, Great Britain might have unexceptionable
timber from Norway, and from Canada a supply
of the corn she so much needs, instead of the
indifferent wood, from the use of which her
houses and her shipping are suffering. Let her
still procure wood from her colony, which may
serve the inferior purposes for which its texture
fits it; but to refuse European timber, and persist
in building frigates and dwelling-houses
which shall hold out only half as long as they
might last for the same money,—the people
crying out all the while for Canadian wheat,—is
a policy whose wisdom is past my comprehension.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such is generally the result, it seems to me,”
observed Mrs. Serle, “when one party is grasping,
and a second self-denying, in order to exclude
a third. The matter generally ends in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.100'>100</span>injury of all three. If they would only follow
the old saying, ‘Live and let live,’ all would
do well,—all would do best.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is that rule so violated as here?” said
Mr. Serle, looking abroad from the verandah upon
the approach of a fleet of barks with firewood,
for the nightly sacrifice to the Moloch of monopoly.
“Your colonial government here, Mr.
Carr, manages to live,—to sustain itself by shifts
and devices; but as to letting live, let the extinguished
fires on the shore, and the cry of the
jackal in the woods, bear their testimony.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And your evening countenance,” added his
wife. “I almost dread to see you come home
from visiting your neighbours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mamma said yesterday,” observed Alice, “that
she wished Mr. Serle would stay away, unless
he would look as merry as he used to do. She
says——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear love, what can you be thinking
of?” cried Mrs. Carr, now roused to something
like energy of manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is thinking of your happy exemption
from beholding the signs of suffering which are
daily brought before my eyes in the pursuit of
my vocation,” mildly replied Mr. Serle. “But
if I were to stay away till I saw nothing to make
me look grave,—if I were to stay away till I saw
the men grow honest, and the women cheerful,
and the children comely,—till there were no
struggles of poverty by day, or of death by
night,—I fear we should both be grey-haired
before we could meet again.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.101'>101</span>Mrs. Carr did not mean anything, by her
own account; and the group were, therefore,
left to ponder the full significance of the missionary’s
words.</p>

<h3 id='ch2.6' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br> <br> BLITHE NEWS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Few indeed were the places in the island where
there were no struggles of poverty by day, or of
death by night. In Rayo’s hut, the poverty
struggle seemed to be drawing near its close,
and that of death impending. There needed the
agency of no hag to touch the dwellers in the
jungle with leprosy; no curse from above to
make them feel as outcasts in their own land.
The sunny days and starlight nights of the dry
season were full of dreariness. Rayo, now the
victim of leprosy in its most fearful form, passed
the day in solitude,—now creeping from his mat
to his threshold, and there finding that his swollen
limbs would carry him no farther; now achieving
with much toil, his daily walk in search of the
honeycomb of the hollow tree, or of any windfall
of the fruit he could no longer climb to reach.
The pitcher-plant grew all around his hut, and
regularly performed its silent service of preparing
the limpid draught to satisfy his feverish longing;
but the monkeys were now too strong for him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.102'>102</span>and often, in a state of desperate thirst, he saw
a pert ape, or an insolent baboon, twist the green
cup from its tendril, and run up a tree with it, or
upset the draught before his eyes. If ever he got
far enough to look out upon the open landscape,
it stirred his spirit to see the herds of buffaloes
on the hill-side, and the proud vessels on the distant
main, bringing luxuries from many a clime;
feeling, as he did, that the food and the wine
thus exhibited to him would have preserved him
from his disease, and kept Marana, in all her
youth and strength, by his side. If he met a
countryman, with whom to speak, his tumultuous
thoughts were not calmed; for he heard tell of
the high price which cinnamon bore this season,
on account of the lucky damage done by lightning
to the crop. To him and his countrymen
it signified little whether the Honourable Company
were enabled to ask the prices of such a
scarce season as this, or whether they sought
from government a compensation for the loss
occasioned by an over-supply; Rayo and his
countrymen had no part nor lot in the harvests
of their native island; but Rayo had in the concerns
of the rulers the deep stake of unsatisfied
revenge. As often as he became sensible of a
new loss of strength, as often as any of the horrible
symptoms of elephantiasis met his consciousness,
he drew sharp and brief inferences respecting
the philosophy of colonization, which
might have been worthy the ear of a British
parliament, if they could have been echoed so
far over the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.103'>103</span>Marana, meanwhile, was hurrying northwards
with all the speed of which her wasted frame was
capable. She pushed on eagerly by day, now
in heat and now in damp, and halted unwillingly
at night under the shelter of some rest-house
provided for travellers of a different caste. When
she looked upon the withered garlands that dangled
from the corner-posts, and longed for the
draperies of cotton by which healthier persons
than herself had been sheltered from the night-dews,
she too felt,—though of a milder and more
placable nature than her husband,—that some
one had stepped in between them and Providence,
and turned their native paradise into a
dreary wilderness. She had heard strangers
marvel at the absence of singing-birds in her
native glades at noon, and among the bowers of
the banian, when the sinking sun peeps beneath
its arches, and she had accounted for it to such
marvellers, by tales of the wars between the serpent
and his feathered prey; but to her it seemed
strange that none should ask why the warblings
of human gladness were so seldom heard in a
region whence their outpourings should echo to
heaven. If asked to account for this silence
also, she would have told of the wily and venomous
agency of monopoly, which wages war
against the helpless, from generation to generation,
till the music of joy is forgotten in the land.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana’s spirits rose as she approached the
northern parts of the island, and, leaving woods
and hills behind her, entered upon the level and
sandy region, whose aspect never changed but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.104'>104</span>as the sea, which was its boundary, was gleaming
or grey, as the heavens were clear or clouded.
The bare shore near her father’s dwelling was
above all beloved; and she stopped for an instant
to listen to the tide as it made itself heard
above her throbbing pulses, before she stole
across the well-known threshold.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cottage looked as it used to look, except
that there were no remains of the household
decorations which the neat-handed love to prepare
in countries where decoration requires no
expenditure but of skill. Her mother-of-pearl
shells, her embroidery of fish-bones, her tufts of
many-coloured sea-weed, had disappeared; and
instead of these, there were more snake skins, a
new set of sharks’ fins, and a larger variety of
inexplicable charms. Her father slept upon his
mat, a ray of moonlight falling across his brow
from a chink in the frail roof of his cottage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana was afraid to waken and alarm him
while there was no more light than this in the
cottage. She refrained till she had caught a
handful of fire-flies, and fixed them in her hair,—there
being no sign of fire in any neighbouring
cottage. This done, she bent over the Charmer,
and charmed away his sleep. He gazed at her
long; and, common as was the sight of his dark
countrywomen crowned with a green flame, the
figure before him was so like one which he had
often expected to see in vision, that the repeated
sound of her voice was necessary to assure him
that it was indeed his daughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are flying before Amoottra, my child,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.105'>105</span>or she has already laid her hand upon you. Not
the less shall your head rest on my bosom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Before she could rest, Marana said, she must
confess her impiety in parting with her charm,
and obtain another. She sorely repented having
sold the chank. The gold it brought was presently
consumed; and what was gold in a country
where it could not be made to reproduce
itself, or answer any purpose beyond delaying
want for a time? She would take any vow
Father Anthony should prescribe, not to part
with any other charm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father Anthony will tell you,” replied her
father, with a smile, “that it is better to grow
and sell cinnamon than to get a charm blessed,
and then part with it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana prayed her father not to mock her,—not
to speak of forbidden traffic to one who was
deep in sin already. She was told in reply that
growing cinnamon was not one of the crimes on
which the heavens frown, but an act which the
will of man makes innocent or guilty. It was
now the will of man to pronounce it innocent,
and every man in Ceylon might have his cinnamon
garden, and go unharmed by the powers of
the earth or of the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>But how had this miracle taken place? And
was it so with pearls?</p>

<p class='c001'>“The pearl banks are still sacred, my child;
but, as for the spice, it is no miracle that the
owners are tired of their losses. Much gold
must they pay to the Challias, and much more
must they risk on the seas; and when the spice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.106'>106</span>is landed in their own country, the buyers complain
that any thing that grows upon a common
tree should be worth so much. Three years
since, even the rich would not buy half that was
prepared, though much was burned, as usual.
Then the king gave up some of his share of the
price, and immediately there were three eaters of
cinnamon where there was one before; and, instead
of the king losing, the people gained by
more of them being able to consume the spice.
What wonder, after this, if more cinnamon is
permitted to be grown, that more may eat, and
more grow rich by selling it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But who will buy it of us, father?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come and see, at the next fishery. Any
man of whatever nation, who wishes to buy of
you, may do it in the open market, and no punishment
shall follow to him or you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if Rayo had a boat, father, and carried
spice to any ships he might meet upon the sea,
would not that be a crime?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A crime no longer, Marana. He may take
dollars from the Spaniard, and silk from the
Italian, and cotton from the Englishman, and
iron from the Russian, and grain from the American,
and no one will ask him how he got his
wealth, or threaten those who exchange with
him. I will go with you, and plant and bless
your first shrub with my own hands.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rayo’s hands are too feeble to dig, and he
cannot kneel for your blessing,” observed Marana,
mournfully. “Will there be any more
burning of cinnamon, father?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.107'>107</span>“Never more till all people in every land
shall have had their fill, and the cinnamon twigs
with which we light our fires shall be used unbarked
through their abundance. Why should
there be destruction of any good thing when the
many are to decide what price they will give,
instead of the few what price they will take?”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was the best news Marana had yet
heard, and her father had no more to tell.
While he was moving about, preparing for the
exercise of his art, and leaving his mat for his
daughter’s repose, he told of poverty and sickness
among his neighbours, to whom it mattered
not whether the fishery proved a rich or a ruinous
one. In the former case, they derived none of
the benefits; in the latter, they could scarcely
be starved down to a lower point than they were
sure to reach in the intervals of the seasons.
His representations were confirmed to Marana
when she went abroad in the morning to seek
Father Anthony, and accost any friends she
might meet by the way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Old Gomgode, her father-in-law, lay on the
beach, glancing about him with his restless eyes
for something to feed his inquisitiveness. There
was no inducement at present to go to sea in
search of curiosities, there being no fair at this
season, and none of his neighbours being wealthy
enough to make purchases when each had no
thing to do but to secure his own scanty provision
for the day. Gomgode’s sole employment
was asking questions of any one he could meet,
and longing for the sight of an unaccustomed
face.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.108'>108</span>He started up as he recognized Marana’s form,
though wasted, and her gait, though feeble and
spiritless. When he had asked a multitude of questions,—where
was Rayo? how was Rayo? why
did not Rayo come? and so forth, he was struck
dumb by the tidings of his son’s afflictions. He
silently pointed to the cottage where Neyna, his
daughter, might be found, and lay down on his
face to importune the saints with prayers for his
children;—for Neyna, who was awaiting a dowry
he could not earn for her; for Marana, who was
likely to be a widow before she was a mother;
and for the sufferer who was pining in his distant
solitude.—Before his prayers were ended, Father
Anthony had joined him, and was uniting in his
intercessions when the young women appeared
to ask the priest’s blessing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana had not found Neyna in the cottage,
but bathing with her companions in a reedy pool
behind the dwellings. There was something left
among these maidens of the sportiveness which
seems to belong to the most refreshing exercise of
bathing, and which was Marana’s wont in her
younger days. There was now a song and now
a laugh; now a conspiracy to empty all the
waterpots at once on the head of one, and then
the chace of a dusky beauty among the rushes,—of
Neyna, who had forgotten for the moment
her hopelessness of a dowry. She was startled
by the apparition of a stranger, intercepting her
with outstretched arms in her flight, and recovered
her gravity at the first recognition of Marana’s
faint smile. The other girls wrung out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.109'>109</span>their dripping hair, and came up from the water
to crowd round their old companion, to ask
tidings of the rich land to the south, where, if
there were no pearl-banks, there was every other
wealth of nature; where, as the songs of their
dancing-girls told them, life under the cocoa-nut
trees was all that could be desired; where
thousands of yards of cotton might be had from
abroad, and hundreds of thousands of bags of
rice were landed from foreign fleets. Marana
pointed to her tattered garment, and let fall that
it was long since she had tasted rice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why did she not seek relief from the English?
she was asked. Did not the English come to
provide for and protect the natives? Had not
the English cotton enough to tapestry Adam’s
Peak, and could not they purchase the rice
grounds of the globe?</p>

<p class='c001'>“We,” said they, “are too far off from this
fountain of wealth and mercy. The English
come for our pearls once a year, and then they
see us gay, and observe that our shore is spread
with wealth. They do not know how little of
this wealth is ours, or suspect what our hunger
and nakedness are when they withdraw the light
of their faces. But you live in that light, and
yet you are wasted and sorrowful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The English themselves complain,” answered
Marana. “When there is a bad cinnamon harvest,
the Government complains that the richer
of our countrymen pay no dues, and that feeding
the poor is a costly burden. When there is a
good cinnamon harvest, the Company complains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.110'>110</span>of the abundance, and burns half the crop; so
that the strangers are always complaining, and
the labourers of the country are always poor.
This is the way with us in the south.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And with us in the north. Why then did
the English come? And why now do they not
go away?”</p>

<p class='c001'>This question was too puzzling for any maiden
of them all to answer, and they hastened to refer
it to Father Anthony.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would you have me go away?” inquired he,
smiling. “Shall I set the example to my countrymen,
and leave you to your woods and waters
in peace?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not forbid our fishing in our waters;
you do not bark and burn our woods; you
do not live upon our wealth, paying us only a
pittance for getting it for you. Why, therefore,
should you go?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My children, you speak as if the English
settlers were thieves. You speak as if it was
nothing to have wise and skilful strangers come
to teach you the arts of life. You speak as if
you forgot the protection afforded to you by the
government of the mother country, and the expense
incurred by her for your support.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who is it that robs us, not only of our spice
and our pearls, but of all that many another
country would give us for our spice and our
pearls, if it be not the English?” cried one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are we the happier for their wisdom and
their skill?” cried another. “And as for
the arts of life, do we need strangers to teach us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.111'>111</span>to lie beneath the fig-tree, and sleep away our
hunger?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From what do they protect us?” asked a
third. “If they will go away, we will protect
ourselves against their returning; and our own
expenses we can bear as soon as ships from
every land may come to trade on our shores.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Father Anthony reminded them of the social
institutions which had been established among
them, with the entire good-will of the natives:
but his pupils were obstinate in the opinion that
slavery could not be said to be abolished while
labourers were dependent for daily bread on the
arbitrary will of a monopolizing party; and that,
excellent as was trial by jury, the prevention of
the manifold crimes which spring from oppression
would be still better.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the English were to withdraw their protection,”
said Father Anthony, “would you
forbid them your shores?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They should be more welcome than they
have ever been yet,” declared the old fisherman.
“Let them land here, and we will spread white
cloth for them to tread upon, and carry them on
our shoulders to Columbo. If they will buy our
pearls, the Dutchman, and the Frenchman, and
the Spaniard shall all stand back till the English
are served, and the money that we shall receive
in our fairs and our markets shall buy the merchandise
that comes from Britain. We have
dealt with the English so long, that we would
deal with them rather than with people of strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.112'>112</span>tongues and ways, if they would but traffic as
fairly as other people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, then, should the English go? Why
should they not live in the houses they have
themselves built, and walk in the gardens they
themselves have planted?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let them do so—the merchant, and the
priest, and the judge, and the labourer—if there
be British labourers here. Of these we can make
countrymen and friends. But we do not wish
for rulers, if they make us poor, and so tempt us
to wickedness. We do not wish for soldiers, if
we must give our daughters’ dowries to maintain
them. And as for the government agent, who
takes our pearls, and the Company, that forbid
us to grow cinnamon for anybody but themselves,
if they will go, we will work hard, and
soon make a beautiful ship to carry them away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then it is not the English you object to,
but some of their conduct towards you? Let us
hope that the time will come when you will live
together, not quarrelling for the possession of
what Providence has given to all, but finding
that there is enough for all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why do not the wise English see this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many of them do. The wisest of the English
see that there is little honour or advantage
in calling any colony a possession of her own, if
it would bring her profit instead of loss by being
her friend, instead of her servant. The wisest
among the English see, that to make a colony
poor is to make it unprofitable, and that colonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.113'>113</span>cannot be very rich while they are dependent.
To protect and cherish a colony till it can
take care of itself, is wise and kind; but to prevent
its taking care of itself, is folly and crime.
It is as if every man here should keep his grown
up son in the bondage of childhood. Such fathers
and such sons can never be prosperous and virtuous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who prevents the wise among the English
from acting wisely?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some who are not so wise. Though it may
be clear that all England and all Ceylon would
be more prosperous if the trade of Ceylon were
free, some few would cease to make gains which
they will not forego. Some hope that their sons
may be made soldiers, if there should be a war
in the colony, and others expect that a brother
or a cousin may be a judge, or a priest, or a
servant of the government.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there cannot be many such.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very few; but those few have been enough
to burden England with expensive colonies up to
this day. They are few, but they are powerful,
because the many do not know what a grievance
they are submitting to. The selfish are few;
but it does not follow that all others are wise,
or England would leave off maintaining colonies
expensively for the sake of their trade, when she
would trade more profitably with them free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why do the people not know this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is strange that they do not bestir themselves,
and look abroad, and judge.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where should they look?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.114'>114</span>“To the east or to the west, as they please.
In the east they may see how their trade has
been more than twice doubled since they have
allowed some little freedom of traffic; and they
are told every year how expensive is this island,
where no trade is free. They might know that,
with the greatest natural wealth, this island is
among the least profitable of their colonies.
They might know that its total revenue does not
pay its expenses, and that no making shifts, no
gathering in of money from all quarters, can
prevent its being a burden to them and to their
children, if they persevere in their present management.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what may they learn by looking westward?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That the States of America are a source of
much greater wealth and power to Great Britain
now than when she had a ruler in each of them.
She is saved the expense of governing at a great
distance, and has more trade with America than
when she called it her own. Also, the colonies
that she still holds in the west are an enormous
expense to her—as fearful a burden as America
is an advantage. Besides the loss which the
mother country incurs for the sake of the colonies,
(and which loss does those very colonies
nothing but harm,) there is a direct expenditure
of upwards of a million and a half in time of
peace, for the apparatus of defence alone. How
much more there is laid out in times of war, and
in the necessary expenses of a government far
from home, the people of England can never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.115'>115</span>have considered, or they would long ago have
permitted, ay, encouraged, Canada and Jamaica
to govern themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the English will but let us take care of
ourselves, they may, perhaps, learn a new lesson
about the places in the west.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am happy to tell you that a beginning is
already made. There is only one among you—your
father, Marana—to whom I have yet told
the news. Every man may now plant cinnamon
in his garden, and sell it to whomsoever he
pleases. The news will not be long in flying
round the world, and then more and more will
ask for cinnamon continually; your countrymen
will grow a greater quantity, and obtain a larger
variety of comforts in exchange.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you will have to preach to us as they
say you preach to the strangers,—against gay
dresses, and rich food, and too much love of
gold,” said the old man, chuckling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if so, less against theft, and fraud, and
hypocrisy, and indolence,” replied the priest.
“There will be little stealing of chanks when all
may fish them; little false bargaining when bargains
shall have opportunity to become fair; little
pretence of penitence hiding a mocking heart,
when there is room for real thankfulness, and for
a sense of ingratitude to a bountiful God; and
much more industry when the rewards of industry
are within reach. However true it may
be that mortal men sin while they are mortal
men, it is certain that they change their sins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.116'>116</span>with their outward state, and change them for
the better as their state improves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some tempters from above must be worse
than others, I suppose,” said Gomgode; “but
it is surprising to think that our rulers have
power to send away the worst, that some less bad
may come in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana hoped that her husband might benefit
by the change. If his elephantiasis could but
turn into some disease less dreadful, how would
she bless the relaxation of the cinnamon monopoly!</p>

<p class='c001'>Father Anthony could not encourage his dear
daughter to look for such a result as this. But
there were no bounds to the mercy of God
towards one who repented,—as it was to be
hoped Rayo did. Father Anthony would journey
southwards with Marana and her father, to visit
and console and pray with his unhappy charge,
Rayo. He was ready at any moment to set
forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marana’s ecstacies of gratitude and joy were
checked only by the fear of what spectacle might
meet her in her hut on her return, and by the
mournful farewells of Neyna and her young
companions, to whom no immediate prospect of
a dowry was opened by the new change of
policy. They regarded Marana as about to
enter a land of promise whither they would fain
follow her; unless, indeed, some similarly precious
permission respecting the pearl banks
should arrive, and convert their dreary shore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.117'>117</span>into a region of hope and activity. They silently
received their priest’s parting blessing and
injunctions as to their duties during his absence,
and then watched him on his way. Setting forth
laboriously on his mission of charity, he looked,
indeed, little like one of the intruding strangers
whom they had been taught to wish far from
their shores.</p>

<h3 id='ch2.7' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII</span><br> <br> UP AND DOING.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Marana scarcely knew what to hope or fear
when she had cast the first hasty glance round
the hut in which she expected to find her husband.
Rayo was not there, and she dreaded to
inquire where he was; whether his ashes had
been given to the winds, or whether some of
these winds had brought him vigour to go
abroad into the neighbouring wood. All the
way as she came, sights and sounds of pleasure
had been presented to her, and she had endeavoured
to share the satisfaction of the priest and
of her father at seeing the bustle of the country
people in clearing their ground for the growth
of the long-forbidden shrub; and the joyous
parties returning from the thickets with the
young plants which, when improved by cultivation,
were to form the foundation of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.118'>118</span>wealth; and the dancing girls spreading the
news through the land. She had striven to
thank her saint with the due devotion when
Father Anthony spread the blessing around him
as he travelled; but the dread of what might be
awaiting her at home had borne down her spirits.
A circumstance which had occurred the day
before had alarmed her grievously at the moment,
and now explained only too clearly, she
apprehended, the deserted state of the hut. She
had stolen out early to bathe, and when she came
up out of the water, she found that a thievish
bird was flying away with her necklace, the
symbol of her married state. It was true that a
shout from her father had caused the necklace to
be dropped, and that it was at this moment safe;
but was not the pang which shot through her
yesterday prophetic of the worse pangs of to-day?
Whether her father believed that his
spells could bring back a departed spirit, he did
not declare; but he now hastened to utter them
on the threshold, while Marana flitted about the
hut, taking up first the empty cocoa-nut from the
floor, then the dry skin which was wont to hold
oil, and then the mat on which it was impossible
to tell by the mere examination whether any one
had slept on the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c001'>While she was sinking, at length, in utter
inability to inquire further, the priest, who had
walked a little way into the jungle on seeing
that nothing was to be learned within doors,
approached the entrance with a smile on his
countenance. No one thought of waiting till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.119'>119</span>the charm was ended. The three went forth;
and, not far off, in an open space to which sunshine
and air were admitted, appeared a group of
people, whose voices sounded cheerily in the
evening calm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Carr was on horseback, with Alice before
him, watching the proceedings of the others.
Mr. Serle was digging a hole in the newly prepared
soil, while Rayo stood by, holding the
young cinnamon shrub which was about to be
planted. Mrs. Serle was busy, at some distance,
training the pepper-vine against the garden
fence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stop, stop!” cried the broken voice of the
Charmer; “I have a vow, Rayo,—a vow! I
have vowed to plant and bless the first cinnamon
shrub in your garden.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And my blessing is yours, my son,” added
Father Anthony.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And mine has been given already,” observed
the missionary, smiling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When was ever any property of your Honourable
Company so hallowed?” Mrs. Serle
inquired of Mr. Carr, with a smile, as she turned
away to avoid seeing the meeting of Rayo and
Marana.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Property is sacred in the eye of God and
man,” replied Mr. Carr, gravely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So it has been ever agreed between God and
man,” said Mrs. Serle. “Therefore, whenever
that which is called property is extensively desecrated,
the inevitable conclusion is that it is not
really property. The time will never come when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.120'>120</span>this island will rise up against Rayo’s cinnamon
plantation, even if it should spread, by gradual
and honourable increase, to the sea on one side,
and to Candy on the other. As long as it
prospers by means which interfere with no one’s
rights, Rayo’s property will be sacred in the
eyes of his country. But the whole island has
long risen against your monopoly gardens.
There have been not only curses breathed within
its shade, and beyond its bounds, but pilfering,
and burning, and studious waste.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think it is a pity, papa,” said Alice, “that
the Company did not get a Charmer to charm
the great garden at the beginning, and a Catholic
priest to give it a blessing, and then it
would have been as safe as Rayo’s is to be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nonsense, my dear,” was Mr. Carr’s reply.
He was full of trouble at the responsibility which
would fall upon him if the opening of the cinnamon
trade should prove a disaster.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same charm and blessing will not suit,
I believe, Alice,” replied Mrs. Serle. “The
charm is, in fact, against hopeless poverty and
its attendant miseries,—a lot which the Honourable
Company has never had to fear. The
blessing is, in fact, on the exchange of fraud and
hypocrisy—the vices which spring from oppression,—for
honesty,—the virtue which grows up
where labour is left free to find its recompense.
The Honourable Company——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Has never found its recompense, in this
instance, I am sure,” said Mr. Carr. “We are
heartily tired of our bargain; and not all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.121'>121</span>we have obtained from Government, from time
to time, to compensate for fluctuations, has prevented
our losing very seriously from our cinnamon
trade. We have been thoroughly disappointed
in our markets, and cannot open any
fresh ones. I hope now——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, yes! You will do well enough now, if
you will manage your concerns as economically
as private traders, and put yourselves on equal
terms with the people of the country. There can
be no lack of a market when it is once known
that every one may sell and every one buy that
which every body likes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe so; and that there will henceforth
be no such considerable fluctuations as there
have been while there were fewer parties interested
in checking and balancing each other.
Still,—convinced as I am that we have done
wisely in abolishing this monopoly,—I cannot
but feel it to be a serious thing to witness so
vigorous a preparation for supplying the new
demand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is indeed a serious thing to see a new era
established among a people to whom we stand in
the relation of a secondary Providence. It is a
serious thing to have the power of lifting up the
impotent who have long lain hopeless at this
beautiful gate of God’s temple, and to see them
instantly paying the homage of activity and joy.
But this is surely not the moment to distrust the
exercise of their new strength, and to fear its
consequences.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will poor Rayo ever be able to walk like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.122'>122</span>other people, do you think, papa?” inquired
Alice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Carr had no hope of cure; but it was not
an uncommon thing for the victims of this disease
to live on for many years, without much
pain, if well fed and taken care of. So great a
change had already taken place in Rayo since
something had been given him to do and to
hope for, that it seemed very probable that he
might revive much further, and prune his own
vines, and bark his own shrubs for many a season
to come. He must be assisted to erect a
cottage on the dry soil of his new garden, instead
of remaining in the damp nook which had
been the home of his poverty. He must be
assisted to obtain wholesome food till the next
cinnamon harvest, after which it might be hoped
that he would be able first to supply his simple
wants, and then to afford to let them become
more complex.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is gone to confession with the priest,”
observed Mrs. Serle, as she watched the two proceeding
towards the hut, while Marana’s beads
hung from her hand. “Henceforth, Mr. Carr,
let Rayo’s sins be his own: but I think the
Honourable Company can hardly refuse to take
his past offences on themselves, however long
they have made him bear the penalty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, if we strike out of the catalogue
of crimes,” said Mr. Carr, “all that are originated
by institutions, and by social customs,
against which an individual can do no more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.123'>123</span>protest, but few will remain for which any
Christian priest will dare to prescribe individual
penance. If the heads of colonial governments at
home were fully and perpetually aware of this,
under what solemn emotions would they step
into their office!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps Father Anthony was such a Christian
priest as Mr. Carr had just spoken of, for he returned
from hearing Rayo’s confession with a
countenance full of mildness, and a voice full of
pity. Marana no longer detected under her husband’s
submissive manner the workings of passion
which had often terrified her; and, in addition
to this, and to the decided improvement she
witnessed in his health, she had the satisfaction
of learning from her father that he had so far
recovered his confidence in his own spells that
he was sure the charmed shrub would prosper,
and would avail better to make Amoottra keep
her distance than any chank in the Indian seas.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rest of the party were about to go in
search of rice or other good food. They had
been too much struck by their accidental meeting
with Rayo in the wood,—too deeply touched
by witnessing his feeble attempts to pluck up
the cinnamon suckers,—to think of leaving him
to his own resources in his present state of health.
As they were quitting the enclosure, and looked
back to see how the slanting sunbeams lit up the
eyes of the care-worn family, the two priests of a
religion of promise assured one another that the
time was at hand when here every man should
sit under his vine and his fig-tree, and none
should make him afraid.</p>

  <h3 class='c020'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Colonies are advantageous to the mother-country
as affording places of settlement for her
emigrating members, and opening markets where
her merchants will always have the preference
over those of other countries, from identity of
language and usages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Colonies are not advantageous to the mother-country
as the basis of a peculiar trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>The term ‘colony trade’ involves the idea of
monopoly; since, in a free trade, a colony bears
the same relation as any other party to the
mother-country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such monopoly is disadvantageous to the
mother-country, whether possessed by the government,
as a trading party, by an exclusive
company, or by all the merchants of the mother-country.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is disadvantageous as impairing the resources
of the dependency, which are a part of
the resources of the empire, and the very material
of the trade which is the object of desire.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a colony is forbidden to buy of any but the
mother-country, it must do without some articles
which it desires, or pay dear for them;—it loses
the opportunity of an advantageous exchange, or
makes a disadvantageous one. Thus the resources
of the colony are wasted.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a colony is forbidden to sell its own produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.125'>125</span>to any but the mother-country, either the prohibition
is not needed, or the colony receives less
in exchange from the mother-country than it
might obtain elsewhere. Thus, again, the resources
of the colony are wasted.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a colony is forbidden either to buy of or
sell to any but the mother-country, the resources
of the colony are wasted according to both the
above methods, and the colony is condemned to
remain a poor customer and an expensive dependency.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion, therefore, as trade with colonies
is distinguished from trade with other places, by
restriction on buyers at home, or on sellers in
the colonies, that trade (involving the apparatus
of restriction) becomes an occasion of loss instead
of gain to the empire.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.1' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br> <br> NO NEWS FROM THE PORT.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Walter was so busy trenching in his garden,
one late autumn afternoon, that he paid no attention
to any thing that passed on the other side
of the hedge. Train after train of coal-waggons
slid by on the rail-road from the pit to the
staithe, and from the staithe to the pit, and he
never looked up, till a voice from one of the
vehicles shouted to him that he was a pretty ferryman
to let a passenger stand calling for his
boat, for minutes together, while he gave no heed.
Walter just turned to the cottage to shout, in his
turn, “Father, the boat!” and then went on
with his trenching.</p>

<p class='c001'>The days were gone by when Walter used to
uprear himself from his weeding or pruning, or
stand resting on his spade, to watch his father
putting off for the opposite bank, or speculate
on who the passengers might be, whence they
came, and whither they might be going. His
garden was a tempting place whence to overlook
the river, sloping as it did down to the very bank;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.02'>02</span>but Walter had now too much to do and to think
about to spare time for the chance amusements
of former days. His father had duly and perpetually
assured him in his childhood that “the
hand of the diligent maketh rich,” and that “if
a man will not work, neither should he eat;”
but, though these quotations had their effect,
there were thoughts in Walter’s mind which were
yet more stimulating to his exertions.</p>

<p class='c001'>He threw down his spade in no little hurry,
however, when, in a few minutes, he heard himself
called from behind. His cousin Effie was
running up the slope of the garden, crying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Walter! Walter! is my father here? You
need not be afraid to tell <em>me</em>. Is my father here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your father, no! I have not seen him since
church, last Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, uncle Christopher said just so; but
I got him to set me over, I was so unwilling to
believe you did not know where my father was.
O, Walter! cannot you give the least guess
where he is? I dare not go back to my mother
without news.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter’s grieved countenance showed that he
would afford news if he had any to impart. He
hesitatingly mentioned the public-house.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, there is not a public-house between this
and Newcastle, nor all over Shields, where one
or other of us had not been before twelve o’clock
last night. I did not know whether to be glad
or sorry that he was not in one of them. Now I
should be glad enough to see him in almost any
way.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.03'>03</span>“Before twelve o’clock last night! How long
have you missed him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He quitted the keel, they say, just at dark,
when she came alongside the collier,—only because
he had broken his pipe, and went to get
another; but he did not come back.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter was silent; but Effie could interpret
his thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is certain the press-gang was out last
night,” she observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is the tender stationed?” asked
Walter, pulling down his shirt sleeves, and looking
round for his coat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just in the river’s mouth; but there is no
getting at her. Half the boats in Shields have
been hanging about her; but, there being only
women in them, they do but make sport for the
officers. Nobody but an officer or two is to be
seen on deck——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, ay; the other poor creatures are kept
close enough down below. I suppose, if there
are few but women in the boats, her business is
done, and she will make little further stay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is not a seaman to be seen in all
Shields since the day before yesterday, they say;
and so the jail has been half emptied to make
up the number. Walter, you must not think
of going to look for my father. There has
scarcely a keel passed all this day, because the
men will not venture to the port any more, while
the tender is there. You will not think of going,
Walter? I am not quite sure that it is safe for
you to be working here, full in sight from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.04'>04</span>river. From the other side I saw you as plain
as could be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Effie, what do you think they could
make of a gardener on board a king’s ship?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What they make of other landsmen, I suppose.
’Tis certain they have got some who never
were on ship-board in their lives.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr4.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Yes,'>“Yes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_4.9'><ins class='correction'>“Yes</ins></a></span>, indeed. So I do wish you would work,
in you must work, under the hedge, or behind
that plot of hollyoaks. Do you know I saw you
stop and take off your cap, when you came to the
end of this ridge, and then stoop——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! while your head was full of your
<a id='corr4.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='tather'>father</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_4.15'><ins class='correction'>father</ins></a></span>; bless you!” murmured Walter, in a low
<a id='corr4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='16'>fone</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_4'><ins class='correction'>fone</ins></a></span>, and with a blush of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is not it my duty to think of you first?”
asked Effie; “and if it was not, how could I help
it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter was in no hurry to answer this, and
Effie went on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to saying it, I cannot help that either;
and why should I? It makes me wonder to see
Bessy Davison pretending that her lover is the
last person in the world that she thinks of or
cares about, when she knows what a sin and
shame it would be to pretend the same thing
when he is her husband—which he is almost—for
they are to be married next week.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure we are much more like being
husband and wife than they are, Effie; I wish
we were going to be married next week.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot talk about that, Walter, till I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.05'>05</span>heard something of my father, and made out
what is to become of my mother, if he is really
gone; but he may get back. There have been
some set ashore again two days after they were
carried off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter did not say what he knew, that those
who were thus returned to their homes were
persons unfit for the king’s service:—a poor
tailor who might, by long training, have become
a sail-maker, but would never be capable of more
arduous service; a ploughman, who was gaping
with amazement at the first sight of the sea, when
he was surprised and carried off; and a pedlar,
who seemed likely to die in a week for want of a
wider walking range than the deck of a tender.
Eldred was too good a man for the king’s purposes,
as Walter knew, to be set at liberty again
on the same footing with such helpless creatures
as these.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What will your mother do, Effie, if your
father should really be away a year or two, or
more?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eh! I cannot say. There has been no
time——Walter, if you could have seen her, all
last night, it would have half broke your heart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure it has half broken yours. You
look sadly worn, Effie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, I am used to her—to her ways of feeling
and doing. But she did sob and complain so
grievously, we were wholly at a loss what to do
with her—poor Tim and I, for Adam was not to
be found. I sent to his master’s to beg leave for
him for a few hours, but he was out of bounds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.06'>06</span>and so I had no help. For a long time she kept
blaming my father, till I was pained that Tim
should hear all she said. When I had got him
to bed, I left off trying to reason with her, which
I know I am too apt to do. But, Walter, I am
afraid to meet her again; and that is why I am
lingering here, doing no good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what will she do?” Walter again inquired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose we must all get work, as those do
who have no father to work for them,” replied
Effie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We had better marry at once,” said Walter,
who seemed quite able to prove his point, that
it would be a relief to Mrs. Eldred to see her
daughter settled at once, instead of having to go
back to the pit-mouth, where she had worked in
her childhood, and where all parties had believed
she would never need to work again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It never came into my mind till now,” said
Effie, after considering her lover’s proposal for a
moment; “but I will think about it as I go
home, and try to find out what we ought to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter’s blush of satisfaction returned while
he said something about his wonder how people
had any comfort of each other who were off and
on, and pretending, like Bessy and her lover,
not to understand each other, instead of being
straightforward, and agreeing on what was right
and fit, so that they might depend on each other
without drawback. It was difficult enough sometimes,
at best, for people that had consciences
to settle their minds so as to be at peace; and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.07'>07</span>perplex one another further was, in his opinion,
but a poor sign of love. He might feel this the
more strongly from his being too timid and undecided.
He knew he was; and if Effie could but
be aware what a blessing it was to him to be
never made sport of—never put off with false
reasons——</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie coloured with indignation at the idea of
any one taking advantage of Walter’s modesty to
make sport of him. In her own heart she daily
felt, (and sometimes she relieved herself by saying
so,) that there was no one virtue she should
like so much to have as Walter’s modesty, and
that there was no one thing she feared so much
as learning to abuse it, by accepting the supremacy
he was willing to allow her. Walter’s objection,
as far as he chose to make any, was that
she was too tractable; while his father entertained
an idea much more serious. He doubted
whether they had grace enough between them to
secure a blessing upon their union.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle Christopher seems too busy to speak
to me to-day,” observed Effie. “He has always
been engaged with his invention when I have
come lately; but I thought to-day he would have
come out to advise with me what we must do
about my father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is bringing his invention to a point,”
replied Walter, “and he will soon be ready to
take it to London, and look after a patent for it.
This fills his mind at present; but you need not
doubt his feeling very much for you all, as soon
as he can listen to what I shall tell him.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.08'>08</span>“But what will he say to your notion of marrying
next week—of your marrying while Adam
is not out of his apprenticeship yet?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He can only say that Adam is an apprentice,
and I am not. You and I may be as glad as we
please, between ourselves, that I am a gardener,
and not a rope-maker.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! you would have had another year to
serve, from this time, and then to set up for yourself.
But, surely, gardening is a much more
difficult business to learn than rope-making.
Why should Adam be obliged to spend seven
years in learning to twist hemp into ropes, when
you learned long ago a great deal about the
seasons, and the soils, and the nature of different
kinds of plants, and how to manage a vast number
of them? I should have thought that it
would take more time and pains to learn to produce
fine peaches, and such capital vegetables
as yours, than to become a good rope-maker.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So should I; but all works of tillage have
been mixed up together under the name of unskilled
labour; and all that belong to manufactures,
as skilled labour, which requires apprenticeship;
so that the man who grows the finest
grapes that care and knowledge ever produced, is
held by the law to be a less skilled workman
than one who dabs brick-clay into a mould all
the summer through. If I were to turn pippin-monger
instead of pippin-grower, I should have
inquiries in plenty after my seven years of apprenticeship,
and should be liable to suffer for
not having served them. But I am a gardener,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.09'>09</span>and never was bound to a master, and am now
free to turn my hand to any occupation that
comes near my own, if my own should fail, which
is a sort of security for you, Effie, that it gives
me pleasure to think of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Security!” said his father, who had at length
found time to come out and inquire into the afflictions
of his niece and her family. “It is the
notion of young people, who have not seen God’s
ways in his works, to talk of security. Of what
use is the watchman’s waking, unless the Lord
keeps the city?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, uncle,” said Effie, “we want no
teaching to-day about change and danger. Yesterday
at this time we were looking for my father
home from work, and now I much fear——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fear nothing, child. Fear is sinful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, but, uncle, do you think you yourself
could help it if Walter was gone, and you did
not know where? Would not you fancy him
shut down in that horrible tender? And could
you help being afraid that he was miserable, being
afraid that he would be ill, being afraid that you
would be unhappy for many a long year, for
want of him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I dare say you think,” said uncle Christopher,
seeing that Effie bit her lip to repress her
tears,—“I dare say you think that I am a cruel
old man, who has no compassion for what other
people are feeling. Worldly people would
say——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, never mind what people would say who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.10'>10</span>do not see and hear us: but I do not think you
cruel, uncle. Only——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only what?” inquired uncle Christopher,
setting his lips in a prim form, as he always did
when he expected to hear something unacceptable
about himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only,—very pious people expect other people
to feel exactly as they do, and make out that
every difference is a difference of trust in God.
Now, I trust in God that my father will be supported,
and my poor mother——”</p>

<p class='c001'>She was obliged to stop a moment, and then
went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“But all this trust does not make me the less
afraid that they will have to be unhappy first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Uncle Christopher shook his head with a condescending
smile and sigh. This was what he
called trust with a reservation; but prayed that
the true faith might grow out of it in time. He
could suggest nothing to be done, Eldred’s recovery
being quite hopeless, he considered, if he
was on board the tender. All that uncle
Christopher could promise, was to go and pray
with the widowed wife, on the Sabbath morning;—the
day that he could not conscientiously give
to his own engrossing pursuit,—the invention
for which he hoped to take out a patent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter had no intention of waiting till Sunday.
He was going now, but that Effie would not
allow it. The press-gang was before her mind’s
eye, whichever way she turned; and she had no
apprehension so great as of her lover falling in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.11'>11</span>with it. Nowhere could he be so safe as in his
father’s premises,—ferrymen being everywhere
exempt from impressment. He parried her request
of a promise not to show himself in his
garden so as to be an object of observation from
the river, and now saved his father the trouble of
depositing Effie on the other side. He had a few
words to say to her while they were crossing.
His advice was not to harass herself with running
about from place to place in search of her father,
(who could have no motive for concealing himself
from his family,) but to acquiesce in his
being made a defender of his country against his
will, and to hope that he would prove a faithful
and valiant seaman amidst the perils and honours
of war.</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie thought that the very way to prevent this
was so to treat a man as to make him hate the
government he served, and to paralyze his arm
by that sickness of heart which must come over
him as often as he thought of his deserted wife
and unprovided children. She believed a ready
will was the soul of good service, on sea or
land.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had no very ready will to go home to her
mother without tidings. She lingered to see her
lover recross the river, being aware that he was
an inexperienced ferryman, and that the tide was
now running very strong. A barge was coming
up, in fine style, and it seemed likely that Walter
would have landed in time to watch its course,
like herself, and perhaps to suspect, as she did,
that certain of his Majesty’s agents were in it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.12'>12</span>seeking whom they might entrap. But Walter
mismanaged his boat, causing it to make a zig-zag
course, till he brought it very near the barge,
and then seeming to lose his presence of mind
so as to put himself directly in the way of being
run down. Effie was in momentary expectation
of witnessing the clash, and there was a movement
on board the barge which terrified her no
less.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They have found him out to be no ferryman,”
was her agonized thought. “They will
carry him off too, and then my mother and I
shall be widows together!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She ran to the water’s edge, and would probably
have tried to walk through it, if the boats
had not parted so as to allow her breathing time
again. She was then struck with the improbability
of the gang offering violence to the manager
of a ferryboat, while in the actual discharge
of his office; but this conviction did not at once
restore strength to her shaking limbs, or remove
the deadly sickness from her heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was usually fond of this walk,—for other
reasons than that Walter was at one end of it:
but to-day everything appeared disagreeable. The
rustling of the autumn wind in the leafless clump of
trees under which she had to pass teazed her ear.
She tried to find a path where she might walk
without making a commotion among the dead
leaves. When it became necessary to cross the
rail-road, it seemed to her that it was the most
difficult thing in the world to escape the trains
of waggons. She felt pretty sure of being run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.13'>13</span>over before she got home. The smoke from the
colliery half stifled her, and the voices from the
rows of cottages were more shrill and unfeeling
than she had ever heard them before. The river
side had been cold; the colliery was too warm;
and the wind, or something else, prevented her
getting forwards. She could almost have declared
that her feet were tied.</p>

<p class='c001'>While she was toiling on, somebody touched
her shoulder. She turned, in attitude to run
away; but it was only her eldest brother.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! did I frighten you, lass?” cried
Adam, gaily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Adam! It would be well if you never
did worse than frightening me in this way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hoot, toot! you are coming round to the
old story of my having my indentures broke.
Let them be broke, if my masters so please! I
know my business well enough,—I knew it three
years ago well enough to make my bread like
another man; and so it is no wonder I am tired
of working so long for another, when I am as
fit as I ever shall be to work for myself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the disgrace,—the loss,—if you have
your indentures broke!” exclaimed she. “How
are you to get on a footing with those who have
served their time properly, if you cannot submit
to the law?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish I had been born where there is no
such law,” declared Adam. “If I had been a
Manchester or a Birmingham man, my apprenticeship
might have been as long or as short as
my business requires. Or if I had been an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.14'>14</span>American, I might have learned rope-making
without being bound at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In America, I have heard tell,” replied Effie,
“the people are mostly well to do in the world,
and can take their manhood upon them earlier
than the youths here may do. They can set up
for themselves, and marry, and have their rights
earlier than here, where there are so many in
proportion to the means of living. As to Birmingham
and Manchester,—I do not know what
is the character of the working youths there,—but
I have heard it said that long apprenticeships
are good for the morals of the young people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I must be a much more moral person
than Walter—Eh, Effie? But I should like to
know what there is in my being bound to tread
the length of the rope-walk so many times a-day,
for my master’s profit, that is good for my morals.
I hardly think that it is good for one’s morals to
be running off as often as one can slip the noose,
and sulky and grumbling all the while one is
under a master’s eye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie did not see the absolute necessity of either
playing truant or sulking. She thought a well-disposed
youth should be grateful for being under
the eye of a master at a time of life when
guardianship was peculiarly needful.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All very well two hundred years ago, Effie,—at
the time of such apprenticeships as our
great grandfather used to tell us of,—when the
apprentices used to sit in the same room, and
eat at the same table with their masters, and walk
behind them to church. But times are changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.15'>15</span>now. I could tell you such things as you little
dream of, if I chose to prove to you how much
management our masters have over our pleasures
and our morals. What is it to them what we do
with ourselves when work is over? And as for
the time that the wheels are turning, the masters
must be clever men if they get half as much work
out of their oldest and best apprentices as out of
any one of their journeymen?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How were apprentices so different in our
great grandfather’s time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I dare say it might be more difficult to learn
arts at that time; and so a longer apprenticeship
might be wanted. Neither was there such a rush
to get one’s bread as there is now; nor, consequently,
so much provocation at being kept out
of it, at a great expense to everybody, when one
is capable of shifting for one’s self. You cannot
wonder, Effie, at my flitting from time to time,
when a chance offers of winning a penny, or
when I can amuse myself, instead of toiling for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I do wonder, Adam. You forget what
you owe your master for teaching you your trade;
and you forget what you forfeit, if you have your
indentures broke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I. I paid my master long ago for
everything but the meat and drink that I would
rather earn for myself. And you need not begin
to talk of how foolish we should all be in marrying
too early if our being bound till twenty-one
did not prevent it. It may chance that worse
things than early marriages happen when high-spirited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.16'>16</span>apprentices are led or driven into a disposition
for idleness. In my mind,—the best
way to keep a young man steady and sober is
to let him work, as soon as he is fit for it, with
the hopefulness which comes from working for
one’s self. You will see how steady I shall be
as soon as I have something to work for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if your master casts you off, mean
time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I must go somewhere away from yon
great town, where one can do little without a
title of apprenticeship. When the Deep Cut is
made,—as they say it certainly will be,—ropes
will be wanted there in plenty, for ships that will
put in. I’ll go and settle near the Deep Cut.—’Tis
a fine place,—that sluice that is to be.
Tommy Thorn and I got over to see it in one of
our trips; and there was——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell me nothing about it now,” said Effie:
“but go home to your master, that I may tell
my mother that you are there; and so carry her
some little comfort in her misery.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Misery! what misery?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! Now you are almost the only person
within five miles that does not know what an
affliction has befallen your own kin. I kept
putting off the telling you, being at last hopeless——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I saw how you had been crying, but
thought Walter might have been either rough or
particularly tender. But O, Effie, what is it?
Is poor little Tim——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tim was well again: and Adam was horror-struck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.17'>17</span>at finding the family misfortune so much
greater than he had anticipated. When he
learned that Cuddie was absent,—making his first
voyage in a collier to London,—he was full of
remorse that his mother had been left without the
support of either of her elder sons on such an
occasion. Instead of going home to his master,
he must first see his poor mother; and when
Effie recollected that such a visit might serve as
a plea of excuse to his master, and give his indentures
another chance, she made no further
opposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie found little promise of comfort on approaching
home. About the spout or staithe,
whence coals were shot from the waggons into
the keels on the river, were gathered groups of
people telling and hearing of one and another
neighbour who had not returned when expected.
This news rendered Eldred’s restoration less probable
than ever, and all that could be hoped was
that Mrs. Eldred was already prepared for this.</p>

<p class='c001'>If she was, she did not look out the less
eagerly for her daughter, or show less disappointment
when she found there were no tidings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was silly of me to trouble you for any,”
she declared. “I am the last person ever to get
tidings that I want. I am the last person to be
helped by anybody.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not you think——”—Effie began, but
checked herself, in consideration of the trouble of
spirit that her mother was in. The poor woman
went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“One would think the time was gone by for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.18'>18</span>your father to have the notion of deserting his
family. He had better have done it years ago,
when I was more fit for the charge. I am worn
out now. But I always said there would be no
rest for me till I was in the grave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there no one who asks us to come and he
will give us rest?” inquired one who was sitting
beside the hearth, with little Tim on his knee.
It was Mr. Severn, the clergyman, one of poor
Tim’s best friends. Tim was only six years old;
but he had lost his sight by an accident at the
coal-pit, two years before. He was not an unhappy
child at any time; but he was seldom so
happy as when Mr. Severn’s cheerful voice and
steady step came near, or when there was something
new to be told or taught, which required
that Tim should stand between the gentleman’s
knees, or sit with an arm over his shoulder. He
heard Mr. Severn’s question now, and asked
who made that promise. The answer brought
his mother to tears; but whether they were tears
which would do her good seemed doubtful to
those who watched with alarm the force of her
emotions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother, you cannot think,—surely you cannot
think that my father has left us of his own
accord?” remonstrated Adam.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he has, it is you that have helped to
send him away. No man was prouder than your
father that no vagabond ever belonged to him;
and many a time of late has he prophesied that
you would turn out a vagabond;—many a time,
I can tell you, Adam, when he has heard of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.19'>19</span>being missed from your work. I hope you will
take it to heart, Adam.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother! mother! this is not the time,” said
Effie, in a terror lest Adam should quit the cottage,
never to return. “Mother, my father
never spoke harshly about Adam, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Harshly! no. He never spoke harshly to
anybody in his life, and always let any one talk
him over, and do what they would with him; and
that is the case now, I’ll answer for it. I thought
I had brought up my sons free from his fault;
and now they are to break my heart in another
way, I suppose. Well! among one and another,
I shall soon be in my grave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How is Cuddie to break your heart, mother?
I wonder what is the matter with him, good lad!”
said Adam, with an affectation of coolness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie cast an imploring look at him, and at the
same moment Tim began to make his voice
heard,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, don’t go! don’t go! Sir, sir; don’t
go!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I must, my dear boy. I will come back
again when——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When my mother does not insult me before
you, sir,” said Adam. “But you will hardly find
me here next time, after what you have heard
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, Adam, I trust I shall. I shall forget
what I have heard, because it was said in a moment
of irritation; and you will remember, I
trust, that your mother is in deep affliction, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.20'>20</span>that her words should not be reckoned too strictly
against her,—least of all by her son.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot be spoken of in this way,” cried
Mrs. Eldred. “I have been accustomed to have
people against me, all my days; but I cannot
hear myself so spoken of to my children, by anybody,
Mr. Severn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell us, then, how we shall think of you,—how
we shall pray for you in your sorrow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As one that was able to bear whatever it
might please God to lay upon her,” she replied.
Her violent weeping did not interrupt her declarations
that she could go to the pit-mouth, and
work for her living, and preserve the independence
and good name she had always sought for
herself and her children. She spoke proudly of
her family, though she had just before been bitter
against them. She talked of her strength, though
she had so lately declared herself worn out. She
did not want any comfort but what her own mind
could supply her with, well as people meant, she did
not doubt, by coming to comfort her. She forgot
how she had complained, just before Mr. Severn
entered, that nobody cared for her, and that she
might bear her troubles as well as she could,
without sympathy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Severn, who abhorred officious interference,
kindly wished her strength and comfort
according to her need, and was departing, when
little Tim, who had bustled after him to the door,
reached out a hand to catch the gentleman by
the skirt of his coat, missed his aim, and fell from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.21'>21</span>the door-step. He merely slipped on his hands
and knees; but the boy was first startled by the
fall, and then thoroughly alarmed by his mother’s
passion of terror. Any child must have concluded
himself very much hurt, while his mother
was sobbing over him so piteously.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, mother, I don’t think he has hurt
himself.”—“Do but let him walk across the
room.”—“He does not seem to be in any pain,”—urged
the son and daughter, in vain. Mr.
Severn touched Adam’s arm, and made a sign to
let the paroxysm exhaust itself. Effie quietly
placed a cup of water within reach, and closed
the door against any prying eyes that might be
near. The time had been,—but it was now long
past,—when her mother’s emotions had invariably
opened the flood-gates of her own tears. Her
heart was still heavily oppressed when she witnessed
passion; but it was now only quiet grief
that touched her sympathies. When the sobs
were hushed, and only gentle tears flowed over
poor Tim, Effie could refrain no longer, but became
the most sorrowful weeper of the two.
Adam did not know what to do with himself, and
therefore did the best thing that remained. He
took his mother’s hand, and signified a hope of
being a greater comfort to her than he had been.
He mentioned Cuddie; and here was something
pleasant for every one to speak of. Mr. Severn
considered Cuddie one of the most promising
lads in the parish. Mrs. Eldred told how early
she had discovered and pointed out to his father
what Cuddie might become; but plaintively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.22'>22</span>added a supposition of his being impressed during
the voyage. All, with one voice, reminded her
how young he was, and how unlikely it was that
his Majesty should pick out lads of seventeen for
impressment, when an ample supply of full-grown
men might be obtained. Tim had his little story
to tell of what Cuddie was to do for him when he
came back; and his mother smiled, and blessed
the boy aside for forgetting his terrible fall so
easily. In ten minutes more, Mr. Severn left
her, fully convinced that it would be much easier
to count her troubles than her blessings; that
Providence has a wise and kind purpose in all
that it inflicts; and that the best welcome she
could offer her husband on his return would be
the sight of what she had done in his absence for
his sake.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.2' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span> <br> <br>NEWS FROM THE PORT.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Eldred did not give too good an account
of herself when she declared herself able to do
for her family whatever circumstances might
require of her. Within five days of her husband’s
disappearance, she might be found in a
situation which she had not expected ever to fill
again. She was sorting and screening coals at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.23'>23</span>the mouth of the neighbouring pit. She would
not hear of Effie joining her in her labours. Her
great desire was that Effie should marry Walter
as soon as she pleased. This would be one care
off her mind, she declared,—one duty discharged
to her absent husband, whose only daughter
should not suffer by the unhappy chance which
had taken him away. The only argument was as
to what should be done with Tim, during working
hours. Effie was for keeping him beside her,—not
only at present, while she was still in her
mother’s cottage, but when she should have removed
to Walter’s. She thought it more seemly
that the child should play among the flower-beds
than among the coal-heaps, and hinted the possibility
of his falling down the pit, or into the
river, while no one was heeding him. But the
plea of danger would not do. No child of his
age could be more fit to avoid danger from the
pit and the river than Tim. His ear served him
better than the eyes of little ones who do not
think of taking care; and Tim might always be
trusted to discover, by stamping on the ground,
how near he was to hollow places. He
might always be trusted to calculate the certainties
of crossing the waggon-way before the
train should come up, and to find his own path
down the sloping bank to the stone which formed
his favourite seat by the river-side—where he might
sit, and pull rushes, and hear the water ripple.
His mother hinted that he would run more risk
among Walter’s bees than anywhere else. It was
left, at last, to the child’s own taste; and he decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.24'>24</span>to go with his mother. Of all people, he
knew least of the hastiness of her temper; for he
rarely or never had to feel it himself, and could
not yet understand its manifestations to others.
He was very fond of Effie, but there was a charm
about the corner of his mother’s apron which
eclipsed all the blandishments of any one else.
Besides this, Tim loved society,—not only as
being a child, but as being blind. He quitted
even the corner of his mother’s apron when he
heard young voices, and pushed into the midst of
every group of children he could find his way to.
He had an ambition to work as other little ones
worked, and to play as they played; and his mother’s
occupation afforded him the opportunity.
The sorting coal may be done by the touch as
truly though more slowly than by the eye; and
the work which Tim would not have been set to
these five years, if he had had his sight, he was
already permitted to do for amusement, because
he was blind. His mother rectified his mistakes
when he chanced to carry his contributions to
the wrong heap; and his companions learned to
be patient with him when he unwittingly spoiled
their little arrangements, throwing down their
coal-houses, trudging straight through their coal-gardens,
and stumbling over their coal-mountains.
No one seemed to enjoy the burning of the refuse
coal more than he, though to him it was no spectacle.
He always carefully ascertained the situation
of the heap to be burned, and stood opposite
to the conflagration, shouting when his companions’
shouts told that the flame was spreading,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.25'>25</span>and rather courting than avoiding the heat and
the smoke. There was some question among
observers whether the glare did not excite some
sensation through the veil of his blindness. He
could give no account of it himself; and the
point was left to be decided at some future time,
when he should be better able to understand his
own pleasures.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Eldred was at the pit, as if nothing had
happened, the morning of Effie’s marriage, within
a fortnight of Eldred’s disappearance. There
was nothing to stay at home for when Effie was
gone; and no one ever shrank from being alone
more painfully than the widowed wife did at present.
She plied her labour busily at the pit’s
mouth,—now helping to receive the coal which
was brought up by the gin, now screening it, and
depositing the large pieces for the London market
in one place, and the small for other uses, or for
destruction, in another place.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eh! bairn, what makes you turn that way,
and listen so?” she asked of Tim. The boy
jumped and clapped his hands as a distant shout
arose. It spread nearer and nearer; and the
sound of a carriage,—of several carriages,—was
heard. What could it be? It turned out a very
fine procession indeed,—the wedding-party in
whose honour the bells of St. Nicholas, Newcastle,
were ringing, as had been observed by several
people about the colliery this morning. The
Rev. Miles Otley, a neighbouring rector, had
married the daughter of the rich Mr. Vivian of
Newcastle; and everybody near was thinking a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.26'>26</span>good deal about it,—not only because the marriage
of the rector was a matter of real importance,
but because it was a curious thing to the
elderly folks to see such a boy as Miles Otley
had but lately been, grown into so important a
man as he now was. He had had extraordinary
luck they thought, in respect both of education
and preferment;—luck greatly exceeding that of
Mr. Severn, his curate, who was much more popular
on all points but one;—the one which constituted
the rector’s chief importance at present to
the people about him. Mr. Otley’s sporting was
admired, his equipage praised, his preaching was
a matter of question, his parties a matter of notoriety;
but that which found him favour in the
eyes of his neighbours was his opposition to a
scheme for a public work which they thought
would do a great injury to their colliery,—a
scheme of which Mr. Severn could not be brought
to say any harm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some way up the coast there were materials
for a colliery which would have been opened long
ago, if it could have competed with those which
had superior advantages of carriage. A waggon-way
to the river, or at once to the port of Shields,
might have been made; but it was thought likely
to be less expensive, and much more advantageous
to the whole district to make a short cut
through the rock of the coast, just at hand, and
build a small pier, to aid the loading and unloading
of vessels. This opening might also afford a
shelter for small vessels on a very exposed coast;
and there seemed to impartial persons no conceivable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.27'>27</span>objection to the undertaking, if the company
who proposed it were satisfied that it would yield
them a profit. There was a jealousy about it, however,
among some coal-owners who did not desire
the opening of new works; and this jealousy, of
course, spread to their dependents. It was taken
up by the gay young rector with an earnestness
which could not be accounted for otherwise than
that this was the first object out of himself which
had ever been known to interest him, and it
might therefore have the charm of a new pursuit.
He had talked of getting the bill thrown out in
Parliament, had visited the proprietors of the
land in the line of the Deep Cut, to endeavour to
gain their dissent from the measure, and had
been thought to come very near the matter in the
last sermon he had preached (on innovations)
previous to his marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Severn was so far from seeing that the
scheme was objectionable, that he firmly believed
it would benefit all the parties concerned in its
discussion. He knew that more coal was wanted
in the south,—not that the people in the south
could purchase more of the article, burdened as
it now was with duties and unnecessary charges
of various kinds,—but he knew that many manufacturers
were pining for want of an abundant
and cheap supply of fuel, and that thousands of
poor creatures were shivering in their chilly
homes, while an inexhaustible deposit of coal lay
in the ground; and there were plenty of hands
to work it, and an abundance of ships to transport
it, if its charges could but be reduced to such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.28'>28</span>a level as that those who needed might obtain.
Every means by which a larger supply could be
brought into the market would prove, he believed,
a stimulus to the whole trade, and tempt more
consumers to the purchase. Not only, therefore,
would the land proprietors on the line of the
Deep Cut, and the labourers, and the ship-builders,
and the rope-makers, and the pitmen,
be benefited in a direct way, but all connected
with other coal-works in an indirect manner. It
was true that other means existed of supplying
the people more amply with the fuel which they
wanted; but those means could not at present be
made use of. It was true that coal enough,—and
no little of a prime quality,—was destroyed
at the pit mouth to afford warmth to crowds of
those who pass the dreary winter night in darkness
and in cold, in many of the cities of England.
It was true that this destruction was
sorely grudged by the coal-owners, and complained
of by the dwellers in the neighbourhood,
to whom these wasteful fires were a terrible nuisance;
but it was also true that, while the corporation
of London had the privilege of measuring
the coal which was to warm London, and
would admit none which was not in large pieces,
there was little probability that the small coal
would have any chance yet awhile; and the best
hope was in the supply of large coal being increased,
so as to lower the price, as far as it was
possible for it to be lowered under the officious
management of a corporation. As for the means
of carrying the projected improvement into effect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.29'>29</span>as it was a work too expensive for individual
enterprise, a company, privileged by Government,
seemed the right instrument. Such companies
are the fitting subjects of royal and parliamentary
favour, when their undertakings serve
to promote instead of impeding the industry of
the many, and the rewards of that industry. A
company to monopolize the production of coal
would have been a curse against which Mr.
Severn would have protested with all his might;
a company to open a new channel for the distribution
of coal was a public servant, whom he
thought deserving of all honour and encouragement.
Inasmuch as government would be bound,
by its duty of protecting the industry of its subjects,
to discountenance the former, it was bound
to countenance the latter: therefore Mr. Severn
exerted himself to subdue the prejudices against
the scheme which existed in his parish; and, furthermore,
did what in him lay to disabuse Parliament
respecting the misrepresentations of the
counter-petitioners. It is so much more easy,
however, and so infinitely more entertaining, to
join in a clamour against a proposition than to
listen to reason in favour of it, that Mr. Severn
was not at all surprised to hear the shouts which
followed the bridegroom’s carriage,—“Otley for
ever!” “He has cut up the Deep Cut!” “No
new piers; the old ones will do.” “Don’t let
the Cut go out of your mind, Otley. We’ll
stand by you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Severn was visiting a poor man who was
laid up with a hurt received in the pit. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.30'>30</span>turned to the window with a smile as the gay
cavalcade passed, consisting of carriages, in
which appeared to be all the relations of the
bride, and half those of the bridegroom. Her
father, the great Mr. Vivian, perhaps struck the
most awe into the beholders,—he was such a
very great man!—though he himself seemed less
aware of the fact than other people. He had
once sat next the Duke of Wellington, and been
asked a question by him. He had given a
luncheon to the Duke of Northumberland; and
the Duchess had taken his arm in the Assembly-room
at Newcastle. He was a very powerful
man in the Trinity-house; and had had an audience
of the First Lord of the Admiralty once
upon a time in London. Mr. Vivian himself
would have been surprised to know what a great
man he was. One sort of proof of the fact was
now offered him. The surgeon of the colliery,—also
a great man in his way,—arrived in the distance
just in time to learn what an event was
taking place on the road below, in the passage of
the bridal party. This gentleman had an earnest
desire to be appointed surgeon to the Trinity-house,
and had long wished to distinguish himself
in the view of Mr. Vivian. He did so now,
though not exactly in the way to secure a presentation
to the office he sought. He urged his
grey pony forward, that he might be within reach
of Mr. Vivian’s notice, if the carriages should
stop to allow the rector to make his acknowledgments
to the people. The pony did not want
urging, except when it was in one peculiar position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.31'>31</span>of which it was by no means fond—in the
middle of a waggon-way, bestriding the twirling
cable by which the waggons are worked. While
standing thus, as horses in that neighbourhood
are sure to do occasionally, it required no gentle
persuasion to induce the pony to draw its hind-legs
after its fore-legs over the rope; but that
effort once made, it was sure to go on its way
rapidly enough to satisfy the most impatient
rider. So it was on the present occasion. The
animal leaped down the ridge, dashed over the
black level which lay between it and the colliery,
and ended by shaking off his master, and giving
him a roll in the dust, in full view of the wedding
party. The surgeon’s purpose was doubly answered.
Not only had he distinguished himself
before Mr. Vivian, but the carriages stopped, and
opportunity was thus afforded for requesting the
patron’s interest at the Trinity-house. Poor Mr.
Milford was, however, too dusty, too much out
of breath, too anxious about his runaway pony,
to give a very clear account of his wishes and
his claims; and the matter ended with his handing
his card to the patron, and receiving permission
to call on him in Newcastle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three men now appeared with the recovered
pony, holding its head as carefully as if it was
likely to start off without the rest of the body.
Four women held open their doors, with an invitation
to the gentleman to walk in, in order to
being dusted and brushed; and a score of children
gathered round to point out a torn coat-flap,
a burst elbow, and a bent hat. Somewhat annoyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.32'>32</span>and ashamed, the gentleman turned into
the house of the patient he came to visit, where
Mr. Severn was still standing, looking upon the
bustle before the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sit down, sir, pray do; and don’t think of
me yet,” said the patient, looking compassionately
on the panting Mr. Milford. “My wife
will get you a glass of gin, sir, to cheer your
spirits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if,” said the wife, “you would take a
word of advice, sir, you would turn your left-leg
stocking, to prevent any more harm coming of
the affair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Milford gravely accepted both the gin
and the advice. It was a great object with him
to make himself popular with the people, even
when the curate was by. He protested that he
did not regard the misadventure, as it gave him
the opportunity of paying his respects to the
bridegroom, whom he honoured for his public
spirit about the Deep Cut.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When he was a lad at school,—and none of
the brightest, sir,—how little anybody thought
what a great man he would be in the church!
It was his father’s being ruined that destined
him to the church. Nobody would have thought
of it else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed! I should have supposed the long
and expensive education necessary to a learned
profession would have been the last a ruined man
would have thought of for his son.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he had had to pay the expense himself,
certainly, sir. But so much is provided already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.33'>33</span>for a church education, that, if a gentleman has
interest, it is one of the cheapest ways that he
can dispose of his sons, they say. But for this,
they would never have thought of making Master
Miles a clergyman, to judge by what I used to
see of him as a boy. The big boys used to
plague him, as he plagued the little ones; and
the master and he plagued each other equally.
If Miss Vivian had seen what I saw once, she
would hardly have married him, altered as he is.
The boys had buried him up to his chin in the
middle of the play-ground, and when he screeched
and roared, they let him have one arm out to
beat the ground with. He did not then look
much like a youth thinking of giving himself up
to holy things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor many another school-boy, who has yet
turned out a good clergyman,” observed Mr.
Severn gravely. “I have often thought that
much harm is done by expecting ministers of
the gospel to be different from others when they
are men; but I never before heard that they
must be a separate race as boys.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor I, sir. I only mean that one would
not expect a stupid boy, with a bad temper, to
choose the church, if left to himself; and its
being all settled just when his father fell into
difficulties makes one doubt the more whether it
was pure choice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly,” observed the surgeon, “there
are helps to a clerical education which we, in
other learned professions, should be very glad
of;—a great many pensions, and exhibitions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.34'>34</span>and bursaries, and such things, which we poor
surgeons never hear of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“These are all evidently designed,” Mr.
Severn observed, “to provide for religion being
abundantly administered in the land. It is piety
which founded all these helps to a clerical education.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt, sir; but that does not lessen the
temptation to enter a profession where so much
is ready to one’s hand. It is plain to me, sir,
that many are drawn into this department who
would not otherwise think of it; and nothing
will persuade me that they do not, so far, stand
in the way of those whose hearts incline them to
make the gospel their portion. I do not scruple
saying this to you, Mr. Severn, because you are
one of those who have not profited, but lost, by
the plan. You will hardly deny, sir, that after
all your toil and expense at college, one that
cares less about his business than you has stepped
into the living which you might have had if there
had been no other rule of judging than fitness
for the work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Severn could not allow this kind of remark,
even from an old friend of his family.
How was the broken arm? When did Mr. Milford
suppose the patient might be allowed to go
to his work again?</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beg your pardon, I am sure, sir,” observed
the old friend of the family; “but I meant no
offence to you or to Mr. Otley. All I was thinking
of was, that in the church, as everywhere
else, the best rule for having everything done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.35'>35</span>well is ‘a fair stage and no favour;’ and, indeed,
I know no case where favour is likely to do so
much harm and so little good: for those that
have their profession most at heart are just those
who are most likely to struggle on, gleaning only
what the favoured ones have left them, and giving
up half the fruits of their labour to those who
would not have thought of coveting them, if the
piety of which you were speaking had not offered
them a bribe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am afraid you think the gospel in a bad
way in this country,” observed Mr. Severn.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am afraid of something worse,” interposed
the surgeon: “I am afraid you are a dissenter,
my good man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By no means, sir. I am such a friend to
the church, that it vexes me to see spurious labourers
bribed into her, and true labourers shut
out, or kept under. I believe that there is so
much need of the gospel, that the need will
always be naturally made known and supplied;
and that it is only sported with when it is made
a pretence for getting people on in the world
who are much more fit to get on in inferior ways.
I do not much admire the piety of those who call
in strangers to take shepherds’ hire, and doom
the true pastor to be only a shepherd’s dog.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A dog!” cried the surgeon, excessively
scandalized. “My good man, consider what you
are saying: it actually amounts to calling Mr.
Severn a dog.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are two ways of calling a man a dog,”
observed Mr. Severn, smiling: “the one in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.36'>36</span>sense of fidelity, and the other of brutishness. It
is the compliment, and not the offence, that our
friend means.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And there is a third sense,” pursued the old
friend of the family. “The dog is fed from the
leavings in his master’s wallet, and who will say
that the curates have any thing better for their
care of the fold? Has not the law again and again
ordered that the curate should be made at least
equal in condition with the common mechanic?
and has the law ever availed?—And why has it
not? Not because the higher clergy are by
nature a hard-hearted set of men; not because
the people disregard the interests of the keepers
of the fold; but because theirs is one of the cases
which no law can reach. We should see the folly
at once of the law ordering that every pitman
should have good wages, if there were twice as
many pitmen as there is a natural call for; but we
wonder at the plight of our poor clergy while we
tempt idle and foolish men into the profession, to
engross the hire of those who take 20<i>l.</i> a year
because they must starve if they waited for 100<i>l.</i>;
though 100<i>l.</i> would be a grievously scanty recompense
for the toil and expense of an education
like theirs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would be all right if there were no
dissenters,” observed the surgeon, who had now
satisfied himself respecting the sit of his coat
flap, which had been mended by the silent and
thrifty hostess. “These dissenters are shocking
people. They ought to be put down,—interfering
with the church as they do.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.37'>37</span>“Friend Christopher, over the water there,
would tell you that the church interferes with the
dissenters, seeing that they have two churches to
support, while we have only one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But only conceive how they interfere with the
religious administration of the country! Do you
mean to say that if all their dissenting clergy were
swept off, there would not be more room for our
clergy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As there is no reason to fear any such
desolating plague as that must be which would
sweep off so great a body of men,” observed the
clergyman, “our endeavour should be to bring our
operations into harmony with theirs, that——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Harmony with dissenters! And this from a
clergyman!” cried Mr. Milford.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why opposition?” asked Mr. Severn. “To
say nothing of the folly of opposition to a body
which outnumbers ourselves, the times are past
for men supposing that the interests of religion
can be served by strife, or opinions changed by
opposition. Since nobody thinks of getting the
dissenters back into the church by fighting, it
only remains for all professing Christians so to
co-operate as that they may not interfere with
each other, to the scandal of their common faith.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If every church supported its own clergy,
Mr. Milford, and if no one church held out
inducements to double the number of clergy
wanted——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But we hear perpetually that there are too
few of the established clergy for the number of
souls to be taken care of.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.38'>38</span>“See if there would be, if every clergyman by
interest were transformed into a clergyman by
choice. All I ask is, that there should be no
interference in the matter,—no coming between
the religious wants of the people and the
ministering to those wants;—whether that interference
be on the part of government, or of a
corporation, or of pious people who unconsciously
curse the church as often as they offer a premium
upon false pretension and interested service.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, come, my good patient, let me
examine your arm, now I have recovered my
breath a little. It will be a kindness to get you
back to your work in the pit, if this is the manner
you talk when out of it. We shall have the rector
coming to call you to account for flat blasphemy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it blasphemy to complain that Christ’s
church is not tended as Christ would have it?
Is it blasphemy to point out how it is that he has
not due honour? Is it——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no,” said Mr. Severn. “Mr. Milford
knows, as few out of his profession can know,
where dwells blasphemy, and where piety: in
how few places the one; under how many roofs
the other. He sees men under the severest
trial,—that of varied suffering; and if the natural
language of complaint sometimes meets his ear,
he will tell you how much oftener looks of
patience and words of resignation are to be found
in the sick chamber. He knows that if you
sometimes say what he may think unwise, you
have not, in your suffering, given vent to that
which is irreligious.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.39'>39</span>Mr. Milford was ready to testify to his patient’s
Christian bearing under his late trial. When he
spoke of blasphemy, it was only in the sense in
which he often heard it used about those who
speak against the church.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One would think,” said Mr. Severn, “that
if any were jealous for the church, it should be
myself, to whom the church is my all, in every
sense. Yet I declare that what we are wont to
call blasphemy is much seldomer any irreverence
to God than discontent with man’s doings. As
soon as any of man’s established ways of honouring
God are found to be faulty, the cry of blasphemy
is raised against the fault-finder, though
the glory of God may be his aim as well as his
plea. It was once blasphemy to blame the Pope.
It is now blasphemy to hint that poor curates
might be better used. This sort of blasphemy
may now, however, be found in every other house
within these realms; while the real blasphemy is
rare, very rare. Milford, how many blasphemers
have you met with among your patients? I, for
my part, never saw one,—out of the gin-shop.
Within it, two legged creatures are no longer
men, however they may still use their tongues
to bless or curse at haphazard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Milford tried to recollect. He could
remember only two instances;—one of a man in
the extremity of pain, suddenly blinded by a horrible
accident in the pit. This was no case, as
sanity was lost for the time; but it made the beholder’s
blood run cold so that no other such
instance could ever occur without his remembering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.40'>40</span>it, he was sure. The other was also a case
of agony,—of the agony of disappointed hope.
A very poor man, with a sick wife, had been
promised work, and the promise was broken. He
reviled heaven and earth when he saw his wife
sinking from want. But at the first moment of
her revival he repented, and the last of his
sorrows to be got over, was remorse for his
impiety.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You would find it less easy to reckon the
cases of piety you meet with, in and out of the
pale of the church.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are so many degrees of piety, one
hardly likes to say that any body is wholly
without. It is my lot to be much with sufferers;
and while there are some aged folks, and strong
men laid low, who give themselves much to
psalms and prayers, it is rare to meet with
parents who do not tell their children that it is
God’s hand which is upon them for good, or with
children who do not more or less strive to lie still
under their sickness, ‘like a dumb lamb before
the shearer,’ as their parents say.—There is one
such, sir, one of those patient little ones,—as
you can testify, for I know you have held him in
your arms for many a half hour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! little Tim? I have often wondered
what is passing in that poor child’s mind, when
he has lain breathing his feverish breath on my
bosom. Other children, while thus lying still
from feebleness, turn their eyes from the clock
to the kitten, and from the flickering fire to
follow their mothers’ or sisters’ doings about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.41'>41</span>house. This child’s eyes roll in vain, but not the
less patiently does he watch his pain away. I
often wonder what is working in his little mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The thought of my pony will work in his
mind the next time he is ill, I fancy,” observed
Milford. “Do but see how he pats him, and
feels out the mane, while his mother lifts him
up?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The hostess remarked that the best smiles seen
on Mrs. Eldred’s face of late had been won from
her by this little lad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Milford gave Mr. Severn leave to indulge
the child with a ride backwards and forwards,
while he finished his business with his patient.
Mrs. Eldred could not be persuaded to make
herself quite easy about the pony’s quietness, and
go back to her work. She lingered, and turned,
and watched, as the animal sauntered to and fro,
with a man at the head, a dozen boys at the heels,
Mr. Severn holding on little Tim, and Tim
himself now quietly laughing, now encouraging
his steed as he heard others do, and for ever
turning his head from side to side, as if gathering
by that motion all the floating sounds which
could tell him what was passing.</p>

<p class='c001'>A sound soon came rushing instead of floating
through the air, so vehement as to make the still
restless pony rear bolt upright, jerking the child
into Mr. Severn’s arms, and calling upon the
man at the head for all his energies. The cry,
loud as it was, came from some distance,—from
the spout or staithe where a waggon was at the
moment being emptied into a keel. A crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.42'>42</span>soon collected on the spot, and it became certain
that the shouts were of a joyous character.
There was talk of “the gang,” “the tender,”
“the pressed men”; but the tone was one of
triumph, and cries of “Welcome!” were intermingled.—Mrs.
Eldred heard part, and believed
every thing,—every thing that in another
moment would have been absurd;—that the
king had had mercy upon her,—(as if, alas! he
knew her heart-sorrow;) that peace was made on
purpose to restore a father to her children; that
Eldred had bid successful defiance to the gang,
and was upheld by the whole people; that the
world had been, somehow or other, turned upside
down for her sake. She pushed her way, with
an exulting countenance, among the crowd.
She met Ned Elliott, the lame pitman, and
passed him by; and she passed by several other
returned captives;—Croley, with the weak right
arm, and Pullen, the sickly steersman, and Gilbert,
the half idiot, who was allowed to lounge about
the works. All these she pushed past, and, from
the extreme end of the little pier, looked down
into the boat which had landed them. There
was no one else. Eldred was neither a cripple,
nor sickly, nor foolish; he was of the first order
of labourers, and therefore snatched from his
voluntary occupation, and made a slave. Most
who had leisure to observe their heart-stricken
neighbour gazed in silence; but the half idiot
snapped his fingers, and blurted out that her
husband was far down towards the south by this
time, but he sent his love, and——</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.43'>43</span>With a long moan,—the cry which conveys a
refusal to endure, the poor woman pushed her
informant from her with a force which startled
him. She wrenched hands, shoulder, apron,
from all who would have held her to comfort her,
and cast herself against one of the waggons,—not
to wrestle with her sorrow, but to let herself
be overcome by it. Mr. Severn and one or two
others kept themselves in readiness to aid her
when it should not be an insult to speak to her.
Her passion was moving,—but far less so than
that of another sufferer who silently walked away
with face unhidden, and steady step,—unable to
join in the feelings of those about her, but not
expecting them to regard hers. She quickened
her pace, but showed no sign of anger when
laughter overtook her,—noisy mirth which her
heart loathed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A fine bargain his Majesty had of you!
Eighteen pounds a piece you cost him. I wish
him joy of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They might have let us have some of it,
though.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never mind that, now you are back. Come,
lads, wish the king joy of catching cripples at
eighteen pounds a piece, just to be let go again!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish the gang may be within hearing.
Give them a shout, lads! Now for it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whisht! whisht! O whisht! I cannot bear
it!” shrieked the miserable wife. “O, you
barbarous——you mocking wretches——O,
whisht, I tell ye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Shrill as her voice was, it was not heeded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.44'>44</span>many, who were all too much used to its shrillness.
Her fellow sufferer regarded it, and
turned back to beckon her away.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Leave them alone! They don’t heed. Why
should they?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Heed! Nobody heeds me. Nobody ever
cared for me but one, and he is snatched from
me. Nobody heeds me——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Something fumbling with her apron caught her
attention at this moment. Little Tim clung to
her knees, trembling, and his face convulsed, as
she had seen it before, when her voice took a
certain tone, of which she was not otherwise
conscious. She parted his hair on his forehead,
lifted the child, and put his passive arms around
her neck, and went home as mute as he.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.3' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <br> GROWN CHILDREN’S HOLIDAY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Though it was not true that nobody heeded Mrs.
Eldred and her interests, her querulous complaint
to that effect was in some degree excused by the
substantial injuries she underwent, through interference
with, and mismanagement of, the industry
of all who were most dear to her. Nothing was
further from the thoughts of society than injuring
this poor woman and the thousands of others
who suffered with her; yet it is certain that if an
account had been drawn between her and the administrators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.45'>45</span>of public affairs, her charge against
them would have been a very heavy one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her husband was carried off by force to pursue
a calling which he dreaded and detested, instead
of one which was his choice, and in which he
had been prospering in the bosom of his family.
Instead of standing at his oar while passing up
and down the placid Tyne, he was compelled to
face the belching cannon, and encounter toils
and wounds, or death, on the tossing sea. Instead
of going forth to his chosen labour with a jest,
and returning with a whistle, he was driven reluctantly
to his enforced duty, where he brooded
over his wrongs till his countenance grew unaccustomed
to a smile. Instead of catching up
the chorus of the loyal songs he was wont to
hear among the shipping at Shields, he now preserved
a gloomy silence as often as King George
was mentioned, seemed to have lost much of his
scorn of the French, and turned a quick ear to
any word that was dropped about America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Adam felt himself interfered with, too. If he
fulfilled the apprenticeship made by law the necessary
condition of advantages which should be
the right of every industrious man, if of any, he
must not only be denied the power of working
for himself for three years after he had become
as capable of working as he could ever become,
but the very advantages to be obtained by the
sacrifice must be forfeited if he carried his labour
to any market but one, where it might or might
not be wanted. If he did not fulfil his apprenticeship,
he had no chance in the same town with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.46'>46</span>those who did, and must go somewhere else to
work out the rights of citizenship by like arbitrary
means. His privileges were also as precarious
as they were arbitrarily gained. If he lost
a limb,—and all the limbs are needed in rope-making,—he
could not turn to another trade
without forfeiting his rights. It was believed
that he could not even take his place at the
wheel, instead of walking along the line; for, as
it had been decided that turning a grindstone was
not cutlery work, it might be proved that turning
a wheel was not rope-making. There was no
knowing what he might give his hand to, however
resembling his regular employment; since
the law told saddlers that the girths were no part
of a saddle; that cutting the hoofs of a horse
was the business of neither the farrier nor the
smith; and that though a wheelwright may make
a coach, a coachmaker may not make a wheel.
What he did know was, that, however frequently
and skilfully the law of apprenticeship might be
evaded, he could not, under that law, obtain a
settlement, be a master, take apprentices, or
exercise his calling in his native place, without
having served an apprenticeship of seven years.
Many and many a time he wished that rope-making
had been a business unknown to Queen
Elizabeth; or that he had not been born in a
market-town; or that the inventors of trade-corporations
had been carried out of the world
before completing their invention; or that he
had been early transplanted to Manchester, or
Birmingham, or some other of the happy places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.47'>47</span>he had heard of, where the trammels by which
he was bound are never spoken of but as a matter
of marvel. He just contrived to have patience
to finish his term of apprenticeship, that he
might possess himself of the rights it would
secure. His temper and character had suffered
much under the pretended control and actual
license of the latter part of his term; and fluctuations
of health or trade might rob him of his
privileges any day; but he was wise enough, by
Effie’s help, to take them while they could be
had. While doing so, he could have treated any
inquirer with a good deal of rough eloquence
about the policy and the duty of leaving free
scope to all labour to find its field of exercise and
its reward.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cuddie had his list of grievances, too—some
actual, and others prospective,—all arising from
his being meddled with by powers whose duty it
was to take care that he was let alone in his industry.
Cuddie was just seventeen; and, young
as he was, he was liable to be taken from a peaceful
to follow a warlike occupation on the seas.
In the present day, he would have been safe till
twenty-one: then, he was the lawful prey of any
pressgang he might happen to encounter. When
he should become capable of earning wages, there
were many impediments to his working freely
and being freely paid. There is actually an Act
of Parliament to enforce all colliers in the Tyne
being loaded in the order in which they arrive,—as
if the coal-owners were not fit to judge for
themselves of the state of their trade, and to proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.48'>48</span>the number of ships employed to the demand
for coal. Thus, if there were too many
ships occupied, instead of some being laid by
till they were wanted,—all being favoured by
law with a certain portion of employment,—it
must often happen that the depression falls upon
the whole trade. Cuddie would thus be exposed
to wait for his turn, however many colliers might
be in the river, while his master was losing by
the detention in port. No such regulation is
found necessary in the Wear. The masters there
are exempted from the irritation of being trammelled
under the pretence of protection. Then,
again, Cuddie must not presume to throw an
ounce of coal from his ship into the lighter in
the Thames. This office is the privilege of the
coal-whippers or heavers, to whom the good
people of London are obliged to pay 90,000<i>l.</i>
a-year for a service which, in the outports, is
performed for nothing. Everywhere but in the
Thames the crews of colliers discharge the
cargo; but within the dominion of the corporation
of London they are not at liberty to undertake
the work, even though they would do for
2<i>d.</i> what a privileged coal-heaver asks 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for
doing. Cuddie must not only see the coal-trade
discouraged by the enormous unnecessary charges
laid upon the article by the Corporation of London,
but he must be prevented selling his labour
in discharging the cargo, to those who would be
eager to purchase it, if they were allowed by
those who have naturally no business to interfere
in the bargain.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.49'>49</span>The evil of such meddling extended also to
another member of the family—Effie, in her
dwelling by the river side. Out of the interdiction
to sell coal by weight came manœuvring
and bargaining as to the mode in which coal
should be measured. As it was found that large
coal measured one-third more when broken to a
certain extent, and nearly double when broken
small, it became the interest of the shippers to
buy coal large, and break it down before delivering
it to the retail dealers in London, who, in
their turn, broke it down further, to the injury of
the consumer. Out of this management came
the arrangement of screening the coal at the pit
mouth; and out of this arrangement came the
accumulation of small coal, which, instead of
spreading comfort through a thousand dwellings,
spread smoke and ashes over the neighbouring
fields, injuring the harvests, and ruining some of
Walter’s plants and vegetables. The owners had
no choice but of choking up their own works, or
subjecting themselves to the penalties of a nuisance,
incurred by the very act of wastefully destroying
their own property. Thankful would
they have been for the services of some such
strong-backed demon as the ancient stories tell
of, who would have cleared off at night the
refuse of the labours of the day, transporting it
three or four hundred miles to those to whom
this refuse would have been wealth. Happily,
this long-protracted absurdity has been abolished.
It has at last been agreed no longer to sacrifice
the interests of the original producers and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.50'>50</span>consumers of coal to that of the carriers and
middle dealers, and coals may be sold by weight.
But, for long after Effie married, her husband
had sad tales to tell at his dinner-hour,—sad
sights to show in the summer evenings of the
devastation which the neighbouring burnings had
caused in his garden. Compensation, scanty and
capricious, was given; but it was asked with
trouble and pain, and bestowed unwillingly. It
seems strange that while ruling powers are laudably
anxious about the execution of public
works,—to make their roads level and their pavements
smooth,—they should so industriously
perplex the paths of industry, and roughen the
media of commerce. It is a bad thing to lame
horses, and break carriages, and weary human
feet; but it is infinitely worse to discourage industry,
and to compel men to jostle and injure
each other where there is naturally room for each
to greet his neighbour kindly, and pass on.</p>

<p class='c001'>Uncle Christopher looked one evening with
concern, on a hedge which as much deserved the
name of verdure as the shrubs in certain small
squares in London, the morning after a fire in the
neighbourhood. He was on the point of setting
out on his long talked-of voyage to London, on
the business of his patent; and he wished to take
a parting view of the premises he had not quitted
for twelve hours together, since the day he was
made a ferryman many years before. Strongly
as he was persuaded that Walter and his young
wife were, as yet, in danger of a much fiercer fire
than any of the vast number which could be seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.51'>51</span>round the horizon on a dark night, he preserved
such an affection for the results of their toil that he
was full of wrath that mortal hands should kindle a
fire against them. As he here shook his head
mournfully over a row of shrivelled anemones, and
there groaned at seeing the young asparagus
waving grey instead of green, any brother leaders
would have supposed that they were children of
grace to whom all this sympathy was given. At
the bottom of his grief lay the thought that, if this
nuisance continued, Walter would be compelled
to carry his gardening skill elsewhere. He could
not carry the ferry with him, and then would come
a sore struggle to choose between his son and his
occupation. Walter would have been highly
flattered if he could have looked into his father’s
heart, and seen how equally the struggle was
maintained.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see the boat coming for you, with Cuddie
in it—below the bend of the river there,” said
Effie; “but you will have time to look at my
young apricot, and tell me whether you think
there is any chance of its bearing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She received a very broad hint about setting her
heart upon favourites, but was comforted notwithstanding,
by an encouraging opinion about the
apricot: Walter was further told that he might
just mention the asparagus and the apricot together
in the first letter he should write after hearing
of his father’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, father! do you really mean to write to
us?” cried Walter, in joyful surprise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no,” said Effie. “He means that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.52'>52</span>shall hear from Cuddie of his getting to London.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean that if, by grace, I get safe through
the dangers of the deep waters, I shall give you
the opportunity of being thankful for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And when will it be, father?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The times are not in our own hands. Effie,
you say the boat is to be chiefly your charge.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, father, you know I have practised ferrying
a good deal lately, on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is more sure of her oar than I,” observed
Walter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What of that? Why do you puff her up?
Except One guide the boat, as well as build the
house, we labour in vain, with our weak arm of
flesh.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed I am not puffed up about ferrying,”
said Effie. “I know I cannot do it half so well
as you. But I hope to improve before you come
back.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May my office be given you in full! My
outward oar is only a sign, child,—a type of
the corresponding office which I hold, of setting
souls safe over the abyss where they are like to
be drowned, without some servant of mercy, like
myself, to lodge them on plain ground. Think
of this, my dear, as you pass to and fro.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie could honestly promise not to forget this
new interpretation of her office. Cuddie’s skiff
was now very near, and he was seen waving his
hat as a signal; and immediately his uncle
Christopher began assuring his son and daughter
of the strength in which he went forth, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.53'>53</span>faith with which he looked for protection by the
way, and a safe return. There was a tremor of
the hands, however, and a quaver of the voice
which belied what he said, and gave an idea that
he felt much as other quiet, elderly people feel on
going forth, after years of repose in their own
habits, to be startled by new objects and jostled
amidst a busy new world.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe he would give both of us for Cuddie
at this moment,” observed Effie to her husband,
as they stood in the ferry-boat from which the
skiff had just pushed off, with the would-be patentee
sitting bolt upright, nursing the model of
his invention, and looking the picture of resignation.
“I do not know what he thinks of Cuddie’s
spiritual state; but it is my belief that he
would part with us both rather than give up Cuddie
just now. However little he thinks of young
people, he looks up to Cuddie as his main dependence
in the ship and on landing. I am sure
he does; and I doubt whether he would have
gone at all without Cuddie at his elbow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter thought so too, but wondered what was
to be done about the matter of the patent, if his
father should still be nervous. Cuddie could not
help him there. It was to be hoped he would get
warmed for the sport, when he should be once
more mounted on his hobby.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, let us go up into the garden,” said
Effie. “We can watch them longer there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Much longer,—past the bend of the river, and
then once more at the next curve, till nothing was
to be distinguished amidst the grove of masts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.54'>54</span>“Gone! gone!” cried Effie, putting her arm
within her husband’s, and tripping up the slope
with a step much more like a dance than any she
had ever indulged within the notice of uncle
Christopher,—as she had not yet cured herself of
calling him. “Now, Walter, tell me. If we
have to remove, where shall we go?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You seem to like the idea of flitting, Effie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fond as I was of this place before I came to
live in it, you are thinking. Why, as for the
place, I love it as much as ever, as we see it now,—with
these laburnums hanging in this corner,
and the acacia growing up to be a veil and not a
blind. When I saw the moon through it last
night, I thought it would be a sin ever to leave
the place. But——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there is something about it still that prevents
your being happy here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O no, no. Nothing to prevent my being
happy. I am very happy,—happier than you will
ever be, I am afraid, Walter; for, try as you will,
you always find something to be fretted and
anxious about, though you take more and more
pains to hide it, even from me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure,” said Walter, very seriously, “I
grow less and less anxious and distrustful;—ever
since——not exactly ever since I knew you, for
we knew each other before we could talk; but
ever since I knew——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well; I understand what you mean;
and you began describing that moment to me one
day, just as if I knew nothing of it myself. O,
Walter, do you really think there are any people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.55'>55</span>that have passed through life without knowing
what that moment was,—that stir in one’s heart
on being first sure that one is beloved? It is
most like the soul getting free of the body, and
rushing into Paradise, I should think. Do you
suppose anybody ever lived a life without having
felt this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter feared it might be so; but if so, a man
missed the moment that made a man of one that
was but an unthinking creature before; and a
woman, the moment best worth living for, and
that which joined her past life to the nothing that
went before, and her future life to the heaven of
realities that was to come after. But one thing
he grieved to be sure of;—that this moment
was not received as the token from God which
it was designed to be; but in far, far too many
cases, put away and denied. If this was done as
a duty, and altogether as an act of the conscience,
it only remained to be sorry that such a putting
away was a duty,—but he was more than sorry,—he
was ashamed and angry to witness the expectation
in so many that they could bring back
this moment whenever they pleased;—that they
could call upon God to breathe into their hearts
as often as they could bring their worldly interests
to agree with His tokens.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me,” said Effie, “that though
God has kindly given this token of blessedness
to all,—or to so many that we may nearly say
all,—without distinction of great or humble, rich
or poor,—the great and the lowly use themselves
to the opposite faults. The great do not seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.56'>56</span>think it the most natural thing to marry where they
first love; and the lowly are too ready to love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is because the great have too many
things to look to, besides love; and the lowly
have too few. The rich have their lighted palaces
to bask in, as well as the sunshine; and they
must have a host of admirers, as well as one
bosom friend. And when the poor man finds
that there is one bliss that no power on earth can
shut him out from, and one that drives out all
evils for the time,—one that makes him forget
the noonday heats, and one that tempers the keen
north wind, and makes him walk at his full
height when his superiors lounge past him in the
streets,—no wonder he is eager to meet it, and
jogs the time-glass to make it come at the
soonest. If such a man is imprudent, I had
rather be he than one that first let it slip through
cowardice, and would then bring it back to gratify
his low ambition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And for those who let it go by for conscience’
sake, and do not ask for it again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, they are happy in having learned what
the one feeling is that life is worth having for. They
may make themselves happy upon it for ever, after
that. O, Effie, you would not believe,—nothing
could make you believe what I was the day before
and the day after I saw that sudden change of look
of yours that told me all. The one day, I was shrinking
inwardly before everything I had to do, and
every word of my father’s, and everybody I met;
and was always trying to make myself happy in
myself alone, with the sense of God being near me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.57'>57</span>and with me. That other day, I looked down
upon everybody, in a kindly way;—and yet I
looked up to them too, for I felt a respect that I
never knew before for all that were suffering and
enjoying; and I felt as if I could have brought
the whole world nearer to God, if they would
have listened to me. I shall never forget the
best moment of all,—when my mind had suddenly
ceased being in a great tumult, which had
as much pain as pleasure in it. I had left my
father getting up from breakfast, and I was just
crossing yonder to take up my rake, when I said
distinctly to myself, ‘she loves me;’ and heaven
came down round about me that minute.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie could have listened for aye; but the cry
was heard from below—“Ferry!”—and she must
go. Her husband “crossed to take up his rake,”
and found occasion to remark at the instant that
Effie tripped along as like the Effie of <em>that</em> day
as if no day had intervened. Only her face
showed the difference; and that was as if a new
and higher spirit had come down to dwell in her.</p>

<p class='c001'>On her return, the question recurred,</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we have to leave this place, where shall
we go?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Somewhere near the Deep Cut, it is my
opinion. There will be much custom of all sorts
there, when it is opened as a place of trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there will be collieries near, and more
burnings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so as to trouble us, for some time to
come. The proportion they have been in the
habit of burning here, you know, is about 20 per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.58'>58</span>cent. It will be some time before this becomes
of much consequence in a new situation; and we
will choose our place carefully. Besides, I cannot
but think that, before long, everybody will
see the folly of making such waste, for the sake
of selling coal by measure instead of weight.
If so, there will soon be an end of the burning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you think garden stuff will be much in
request in the Deep Cut.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt. There will be such a settling of
people about that beautiful sluice, that there will
be room for more gardeners than one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And for ropemakers, among other craftsmen.
I think Adam had better go, and make new
ropes for the new ships that will carry away the
new coals.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! if he was settled down with us in a
place where he might work prosperously for himself,
he might prove steadier than his mother expects
he will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Beside us,—not with us,” said Effie. “You
would not think of having any one to make a
third again, would you? How comfortable every
thing is this evening, while we are alone!——But
how do you think your father will get on by
himself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter had never entertained the idea of
being of much consequence to his father, from
the day of his childhood, when he was surprised
at being searched for, at night-fall, among the
haycocks, to this very afternoon, when he was
full as much astonished to learn that his father
meant to write to him. He agreed, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.59'>59</span>that his parent ought not to be left, unless the
destruction of the garden should make the removal
a matter of necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we must go, it will be a happy chance that
such an opening offers in the neighbourhood.—What
could the rector mean by throwing difficulties
in the way?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He knows best; but I suppose he has some
such fears as I have heard certain gentry had
when turnpike roads were first introduced into
this country. There were petitions in those
days from the proprietors of land near London,
that turnpike roads might be forbidden in distant
counties, for fear there should be too much competition
in articles of agricultural produce.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They have managed to have their own way,
and regard their own interests pretty well since,
for all the competition and the roads,” said Effie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They seem to have been of the same mind with
Queen Elizabeth, when she sent out orders to put
a stop to the increase of London. They all seem
to have fancied that whenever some people gain,
others must certainly lose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If this is not our rector’s notion, I do not
know what is. But the fact is, whatever this
company may gain by opening the Cut is neither
more nor less than what is given them in
return for the benefit they bestow upon the payers.
As for the coal-owners on the Tyne, they are as
safe as they ought to be. If a demand rises up
for all the coal both parties send out, every body
will prosper. If not, those who can send out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.60'>60</span>coal cheapest will have the most custom, as is
perfectly fair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And there is not the same reason for jealousy
as there might be if one great rich man had
opened this Cut at his own expense, to serve
himself alone, and get all the coal trade to himself.
I do not say that he would not have the
right; but it would account for a jealousy which
would be ridiculous when shown towards a company.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No man in our borders is rich enough to do
such a work as this. It is the proper undertaking
for a company; and I am heartily glad
parliament has given them all the leave they
asked for. In my opinion, it is the business of
a company to do that which individuals have not
wealth or power to achieve; and it is the duty
of government to smile on undertakings which
favour the industry of the people, as much as to
frown on the selfish who would get its grace to
enrich themselves at the expense of others. In
this view, I think parliament as just and kind in
countenancing the Deep Cut, as Queen Elizabeth
was unjust and unkind in giving patents to her
courtiers for the sale of soap and starch, and other
things that everybody wanted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Courtiers selling soap and starch! What
sort of courtiers could they be?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, not exactly like the gentlemen who
are about the king in these days. But those
courtiers did not sell their soap and starch with
their own hands. They sold their patents to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.61'>61</span>companies of merchants, who, of course, laid a
pretty profit on the articles, as the patentees had
done before; and so the people were cheated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cheated indeed! we are better off than they,
to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, indeed; it cheers one’s heart to think
how free our industry is left in comparison with
what it was, and how the fashion is passing away
of enriching the few at the expense of the many.
Great things have been done for the people, indeed;
and it almost makes one ashamed to complain
of the restraints on their industry that yet
remain, when one thinks of what they once
were.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, I do not see why that should be, as
long as there is any mischief which may still be
done away. If it is really a hardship that handicraftsmen
in particular places, and of particular
kinds, should be tied down to a seven years’ apprenticeship,
and that masters, in certain crafts,
should be allowed to take only a certain number
of apprentices, and that the Corporation of London
should make the London people pay shamefully
dear for their coals, and hurt our fields and
gardens, and that men should be taken from a
prosperous occupation to follow one that they hate,
like my poor father,—it is our duty to complain
till the government sets these things right, however
grateful we may be for what they have already
done, and however we may be better off than our
fathers. It would be a sad thing indeed to have
to pay any price for our starch that our Duke of
Northumberland might choose to sell it for.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.62'>62</span>“And the practice spread to so many articles!
When the list of them was read over, (I have
heard my father say,) in Queen Elizabeth’s parliament
house, some gentleman called out to
ask if bread was not among them: and when
everybody stared, he said that unless the matter
was looked into, there would be a monopoly of
bread before the next parliament.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And was there? I suppose nobody dared.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nobody: but wondrous things were dared
in the reigns that came after. King Charles,
who managed to offend his people in more ways
than almost any king I ever heard of, took
10,000<i>l.</i> from some soap-merchants for allowing
them to manage the soap manufacture all their
own way, and put as high a price upon it as they
pleased. They gave him further eight pounds
for every ton of soap they made, so you may
guess how dear it came to the people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That was a very different sort of company
from the one which has managed the Deep Cut.
This last is making coals come cheap to the
people. I suppose you think they have a fair
right to any profits they may make, however
large.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This particular company, certainly; because
they do not offer advantages which people must
have, and which cannot be had in any other way.
There being so many other coal works, and such
outlets as the Tyne and the Wear not far off,
will prevent the company making such over-grown
profits as the people would be right to
grudge: but the case is different in different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.63'>63</span>sorts of undertakings. If a company opens a
road, and charges too high a toll, another company
may open another road, and cause a competition;
but if a company opens waterworks,
and possesses all the springs within a certain distance,
almost any price may be put upon the
supply: and therefore I think government should,
while giving privileges, take care that they do
not overgrow just bounds. A man cannot change
his water-merchant as he can change his baker
or brewer; and therefore, if government makes
him a customer of the mighty water-merchant, it
should take care that he is not overcharged. I
have heard my father talk a good deal about these
things. He has looked much into them,—not only
because he particularly dislikes being overcharged,
but because his thoughts of taking out a patent
have led him to learn all he could about privileges
given by governments to trade and to ingenious
undertakings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, I was thinking of him when you talked
about those patents. I never found out, from
your manner, that you thought ill of what he is
gone to seek?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor do I, if it answers its purpose. There
is all the difference in the world between a patent
to sell what lies before everybody’s industry, and
a patent to sell what a man has invented by his
own ingenuity, and perfected at his own trouble
and expense. If a patent could secure to a man
the sale of his own article till he has reaped the
reward society owes him, I should think very
highly of a patent: and it is only because it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.64'>64</span>so difficult to secure this, that I have any doubts
about my father’s trip to London. But it is a
hard thing to manage. A world of difficulties
are sure to crowd in whenever legislation is
brought to bear directly upon industry. There
are so many interests to be considered, and it is
so impossible to foresee how and where they interfere,
that my wonder is how governments can
like to meddle as they used to do. One would
think that they would be glad to let industry
alone, to find its own channels and nourish its
own harvests. Indeed the time does seem to be
coming when legislatures will leave off troubling
themselves to meddle with those whose interest
lies in being let alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you think it really signifies very much
to so many trading people as there are in this
country whether government lets them alone, or
meddles here and there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Effie, it signifies altogether,—as much
as possible. How many trading families do you
fancy might be affected by government interference,
in one way or another?”</p>

<p class='c001'>A few hundred thousand, Effie supposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you know that there are not more than
160,000 families in Great Britain deriving any
income at all from trade, manufactures, and professions?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more than that? And, to be sure, many
of these must be so rich that they can very well
bear such interference.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so many,” replied her husband, smiling.
“Fewer than 4000 have more than 1000<i>l.</i> a year;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.65'>65</span>and not more than 40,000 have an income above
150<i>l.</i> a year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Leaving 120,000 with an income below
150<i>l.</i> a year. These last must feel the effect of
restraint very much; and I think, if there are no
more than you say, that all must feel it more or
less.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And through them many that have nothing
to do with trade,” observed Walter, looking sorrowfully
at a favourite shrub which was already
dropping its yellow leaves. “What a mistake it
seems, Effie, to be lighting those red and yellow
fires within sight of this brimming blue river,
and the sloping banks, that look so green in
the evening sun! What a cruelty it seems to be
sending puffs of smoke over the water to touch
and shrivel this hanging laburnum, that you put
into the ground!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie well remembered the planting of that
laburnum. When she and Walter were children,
and used to bring wild strawberries from the
wood, and plant the roots at noon, shading them
from the hot sun under a suspended pinafore;
when Effie used to dig a pond which would hold
no water, and Walter a grave in which he used
to lie down to see what being buried was like;
when they mounted the wheel-barrow to look
over the hedge, and count how many left legs
were jerked backwards as the keelmen pulled
the oars in the keels that passed;—in those old
days, somebody had given Effie a few lupin
seeds, which Walter carefully planted, while
Effie stuck in a twig—dead, as she thought—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.66'>66</span>mark the spot. This twig burst into leaf, and
grew into the tall laburnum which was now
waving its branches against the blue sky; and
every time that Effie had looked upon it, a feeling
of complacency had come over her, as if she
had performed a feat—given life to a tree, or
been the occasion of a miracle. There was
scarcely a growing thing in Walter’s beautiful
garden that she would not have devoted to the
smoke in preference.</p>

<p class='c001'>The smoke looked surly and encroaching as
it rose and spread itself in the darkening sky,
after the sun had gone down. It did not, however,
deter Effie from going into the midst of it,
when it was really too late for Walter to work
any more, and he could attend to the ferry while
she just ran to tell her mother that uncle Christopher
was gone; that Cuddie and he had been
watched in safety a good way down the river,
and that tidings of their further voyage might
be soon expected by letter.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.4' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br> <br> EPISTOLARY GODLINESS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The letter arrived quite as soon as expected.</p>

<p class='c032'>“My dear son and daughter,</p>

<p class='c001'>“By the blessing of Providence we got safe
down the river, though the press of vessels near
the port is very awful. I strengthened my heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.67'>67</span>when we crossed the bar, and the port and the
shipping seemed to be going back from us, and
to leave us in the arms of the Lord on the wide
sea,—now growing very chilly. My eyes were
mercifully directed to Tynemouth for comfort,—not
from the light in the light-house, which however
began to wax bright, but from seeing how
many goodly red houses have sprung up on the
cliff, while the dusky priory stands a ruin;—red
houses where there are some who take God’s
word rightly to heart,—while in the priory (where
this blessed work never went on) there is martial
music sent forth over God’s sea, as sure as ever
the moon rises out of it. This music of horns I
myself heard, and I saw the bonnets of women,
and the uniforms of fighting men, over the parapet
of the castle yard. But when the word has
rightly spread from the new meeting-house, there
will be no place left in Tynemouth for scorners.
It pleased Providence to try us much during the
rest of the voyage. I found the night very cold,
even before I was wallowing in the fearful sickness
which was laid upon me. The wind also
failed, which was a more merciful appointment
than if it had blown a great storm. Nevertheless,
when we were pitching about, and making
no way, I found the collier but a poor, narrow
place, and very dismal from the strewings of
coal, insomuch that I turned my face to the wall,
and found no comfort; but was strengthened to
keep an eye on my invention, which, owing to
good packing, received none of the harm which
I desired might be averted from this apple of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.68'>68</span>mine eye. I was in deadly fear for it during the
adventure in which Cuddie was——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cuddie was——something or other. I can’t
read the word, Effie,” said Walter. “I wish it
was written a little plainer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I wish he would say a little more about
Cuddie,” observed Effie. Her husband went on
reading.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But though hinderances were planted round
about us, they did not touch my invention, to
destroy it. The time spent in going up the river
seemed long, especially from Cuddie not being
at hand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, there again!” exclaimed Effie, “What
can he mean? I declare it frightens me, Walter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No need, Effie; see how the letter goes on
about business matters, and working up the river!
Ah! here it is accounted for,—Cuddie’s not being
with him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We went up the river as slowly as if we had
been set as a watchman therein; and that because
the seamen were tossed in spirit through
fear of the press gang, and would not work the
vessel; insomuch that none but a very old man
and a young apprentice lad would go up with us
to the mighty city. The master was obliged to
hire protected men, and to pay them three pounds
a piece to work us up, which being charged on
the articles we carried, caused our cargo to be
of great value before it was landed. It is wonderful
to the discerning eye to perceive how
small things work out large ones;—how, from
this single need of protected men, there arises a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.69'>69</span>tax upon coals to the inhabitants of London of
much more than a million of money. Nor was
this the last hinderance. Some lighters came
about us, with willing men ready to empty our
cargo upon the wharf. Grace was written in the
face of one of these men, and the master knew
him for an honest and a skilful youth. Yet it
was not permitted to employ him, though he
would have performed the work for less than
those who came after him. These last were
lightermen who had been apprentices, and had
wrought for seven years on the river. They
charge 2<i>s.</i> for the work which others would
gladly have done for 8<i>d.</i> I never learned before
how far better men that have been apprentices
are than other men. I hope the citizens of London
are duly aware of this truth, as they have to
pay so very dearly for it. But these favoured
men use their favour in a way which is not
seemly,—persecuting and driving out those that
would also have boats and yield service. I much
fear that as some of the elect misuse their grace
in divine things, those who are elected into corporate
bodies misuse the powers which were given
them first, as means of protection against the
barons and rich men who used to oppress the
trading and working men in a very ungodly manner.
These corporations are now too much like
those barons of old; for they oblige those who
consume to pay for the good of those who are
privileged—him who burns coal, for the great
profit of the lighterman. It should not be forgotten
that another office of corporations was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.70'>70</span>formerly, and is now said to be, to warrant and
verify the quality of whatever is sold; but it
seems to me that the best warrant is in the interest
of him who produces, knowing that there
shall be no wings of favour under which he may
take refuge; and buyers who are fairly treated
will be sure to verify for themselves. Indeed the
one thing which these unhallowed bodies seem
now to make their business—as they therein find
their interest—is to entangle the paths of trade
to all others, while they keep a wide and smooth
road to themselves. This is plain to me in the
particular of measuring the coal, which, in old
times, might not be done without the permission
of the Lord Mayor, and has always been since
permitted as a profitable work to the Corporation
of London. A profitable work it is—no less
than 8<i>d.</i> a chaldron being the charge, out of
which only 5<i>d.</i> goes to the labouring meters,
and the other 3<i>d.</i>, mounting up to 20,000<i>l.</i> a
year, goes into the treasury of the extortioners.
Verily the hire which is thus kept back cries out,
not in favour of the meters—for they are well
paid—but of the artizans who owe no such gratitude,
in respect of measuring coal, as that they
should pay 20,000<i>l.</i> for it. Why, also, should
they pay in their use of coal for the improvements
which the Corporation chooses to make
in the city? If money was thus raised to build
up what the awful judgment of fire had laid low,
in the time of the profligate Charles, why should
it still be raised, without the choice of the citizens,
who must pay the orphan’s tax of 10<i>d.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.71'>71</span>a chaldron till 1838, to improve the approaches
to London Bridge? The citizens, I fancy, would
much more admire the improvement of having
coals cheap, and would the more willingly pay
out of what they could better spare for the improvement
of their streets and bridges. It was
marvellous indeed to see so common an article
as coal growing into importance as it ascended
the river, and after it was landed, so that it had
gained in its passage from just below London
Bridge to the cellars of the houses, as much value
again as it cost altogether in the North. It was
marvellous indeed to hear of all the dues charged
by the Corporation, considering that they have
no more natural business with the citizens’ coals
than you or I;—the metage, the orphans’ dues,
the market dues, the Lord Mayor’s groundage,
the grand metage, the coal-whippers;—no wonder
we see in London what strangers from the
north are surprised to see,—women stooping in
their path to pick up morsels of coal, and tradespeople
measuring out a scanty measure of fuel to
their servants, while hundreds of chaldrons are
being wasted within sight of your garden.——Of
my invention, it is not good to speak at this time
and in this manner. Much care has been laid
upon me respecting it; it being told me by some
who know, that not one patent in a thousand is
good for any thing, owing to the difficulty of
making it out, and the easiness of invading it.
As there is also no security whatever between
the time of asking for my patent and its being
sealed, you will discern the reason of my not now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.72'>72</span>enlarging on the particulars which you are doubtless
craving to know. But to put a bridle on
the cravings is a great matter, and I commend
it to you in this affair, trusting to be soon brought
face to face; though when, it is not for blind
creatures like us to determine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How wonderfully he has enlarged about
some matters!” cried Effie, “and nothing yet
about Cuddie, or whether they have learned any
thing about my poor father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The letter went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Having thus told you some few things about
myself—(though much remains respecting the
manner of my entrance upon this great city, and
the blessing which has been given upon my Bible-readings
in this house,)—I pass on to matters
of a different concernment,—though but little
time remains before I must close up my large
packet, written in the evenings for the solace of
my mind. Having, I say, told you of myself,—except
that the left wrist, which was weak, has
become somewhat stronger,—I proceed to mention
that I have not met Effie’s father anywhere
in the streets, as she desired I would mention,
if such a thing should happen. It is my
purpose to inquire for him whenever I shall be
able to go down to the river side. But when I
hear what things are done by the press-gangs, I
have little doubt in my mind that he disappeared
in the same way as Cuddie; which circumstance
remains to be related.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mercy! mercy!” cried Effie, “what <em>does</em>
he mean about Cuddie?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.73'>73</span>Walter ran over very quickly:—“not a seaman
to be seen”—“women wringing their hands
on the quays”—“mutiny on board a tender”—“a
porter and two shopkeepers carried off”—“shameful
expense”—“every unwilling man costs
several hundred pounds”—“loss by injury of
trade“—“dark night,”—“O, here it is! Dear,
dear! Cuddie is impressed, sure enough! How
shall we tell your mother?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie snatched the letter, and read.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was a dark night, so I cannot give a very
clear account of what happened,—besides having
been for the most part asleep,—which was a
great mercy, as I might have been more alarmed
than a chosen Christian needs be. Besides, they
might have taken me, but that I look older, I
believe, in my night cap than in the comeliness
of my day attire. By the blessing of God, I
escaped; but my trust well nigh failed me when
I heard a voice waking me with the cry of
‘Uncle Christopher! O, uncle Christopher!’ I
had very nearly given place to wrath when
I heard that cry from over the side of the
ship; but on thinking further, it grieved me yet
more that Cuddie, of whom I began to have
hopes of grace, should have leaned, in such an
hour, on a broken reed like me. But I feel his
loss much, as he was a great help to me; and
there is no knowing when he may come back. I
have not forgotten his cry, and his fellow
apprentice says that never struggle was seen like
his, when the gang, having stolen on board,
while almost every one was asleep in the calm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.74'>74</span>laid hold of him by head and heels to carry him
away. He cried out his mother’s name; but it
has since occurred to me that he may meet his
father somewhere abroad; though, to be sure,
the world is so wide that they may very well miss
each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The air is wider,” said Effie, in a hoarse
voice, “and they may meet there,—both murdered
in the same battle.” There was a little more
about Cuddie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was a very calm night, as I said; and
before I went to sleep again, I heard a little
splash in the water. It was certainly from the
king’s ship, and the news spread that it was
Cuddie who made the noise,—sliding down the
cable, some say to try to get back to us, while
others believe that he sought to drown himself.
If he were indeed so given over to Satan, it may
be well for him that he is in trouble, paying the
toils and perils of the body for the sin of the soul.
You may tell Effie that I prayed for him before I
went to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie was in no condition graciously to
acknowledge her father-in-law’s benevolence.
Pale, cold, and trembling, she sat in the sunshine
which streamed upon her from the window,
looking like a wretch whom the ague had stricken.
Walter had no time now to attend to his father’s
further consolation about the fact that the coal
trade can man a navy on an emergency, and that
one coal owner’s possessions alone cause above
two thousand seamen to be in constant readiness
for the king’s service. Neither did he read the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.75'>75</span>concluding account of himself, or of his father’s
notions of him; of his having been in his
childhood a bubbling fountain of iniquity, in his
youth a spring yielding sweet and bitter water,
and even yet not past being wholly purified.
This last hopeful hint was unregarded in the sight
of Effie’s grief.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is difficult to imagine now what social life
could have been in those old despotic times when
the practice of impressment was general, and the
king could, by the very law of allegiance, dispose
of every man’s wealth and labour as he chose.
It is difficult to imagine what comfort there could
have been in daily life when the field labourer did
not know, as he went out at sunrise, whether he
would be allowed to return to his little ones at
evening; when the artizan was liable to be
carried off from his work-shop, while his dinner
was cooling on the board, and his wife looking
out for him from the door; when the tradesman
was apt to be missing, and not heard of till some
king’s messenger came to ransack his shop of whatsoever
his Majesty might be graciously pleased
to want; and when the baron’s lady watched
from the terrace her lord going off to the boar-hunt,
and the thought darted through her that he
might not greet her again till he had hunted
Saracens, or chased pirates, over many a strange
land and sea. Then, all suffered together, in
liability, if not in fact. All suffered in fact,—whether
impressed or not; for all suffer when
property is rendered insecure, and industry discouraged,
and foresight baffled. Nobody now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.76'>76</span>questions this. Nobody denies that it was right
to exempt class after class from such compulsory
service; and, so long ago as the time of Charles
I., it was found necessary to emancipate soldiers
from this tyranny,—though there were not a few
to predict that no British king could ever again
raise an army,—that England must from that
day bid adieu to victory, and royalty to a throne.
Yet, a more wonderful thing remains than the
fame of Blenheim and Waterloo, and the actual
existence of an English monarch—the fact that
some are found in the present day to argue for
the enforcement of this tyranny on a single class,
when all other classes have long been relieved
from it; to argue about the navy as their forefathers
argued about the army;—that Britannia
will no more rule the waves,—that there will be
no more glory in a sailor-king, no more hope for
a maritime people, when impressment is done
away. Why so? If the service is pleasant and
profitable,—as those maintain who see little
hardship in impressment,—there is no need of
compulsion to make men enter it,—even on the
briefest emergency,—to judge by the universal
readiness to embrace what is honourable and
profitable. If the service be not thus desirable,
why it is not? That smugglers and felons
should be delivered over to the king’s officers,
with the admission that five years’ service is a
prodigious punishment for their crimes; that
the wages of the king’s service are low, at the
same time that the wages of merchant vessels
are raised exorbitantly by the practice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.77'>77</span>impressment; that the king’s pressed seamen
are sometimes paid once in five, ten, or fifteen
years, while in the merchant service the
payment is regular; that the enforced service
may be perpetual, while all other service has a
defined limit,—all this is surely no necessary
part of naval management, while it fully accounts
for the supposed necessity of getting men by
force, because they cannot be had in any other
way. All this fully accounts for seamen dispersing
before a press-gang, like a flock of birds
from beneath a hawk; it accounts for their
changing their names, dressing in smock frocks,
hiding under beds, and in lofts and closets; but
it shames the attempted justification of impressment.
When the trial has been made of the
usual means of rendering this service as desirable
as any other, (and its natural charms are great;)
when the attempt has been made to train up, in
time of peace, a supply of seamen to carry on a
war, there may be ground for argument as to
whether impressment be or be not necessary.
It is wholly an experimental question, and has
as yet been argued only <span lang="la"><i>à priori</i></span>. It is too
serious a matter to subject to injury men’s lives
and characters and fortunes, the happiness or
existence of their families, and the industry of a
considerable portion of society, through adherence
to a false mode of argumentation, and to modes
of procedure too well suited to a former barbarous
age to be congenial with the present. The more
willingly and extensively society is freed from
ancient restraints on its freedom and industry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.78'>78</span>the more conspicuously stands out, monstrous in
its iniquity, the practice of the impressment of
seamen.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.5' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span><br> <br> NOTHING BUT A VOICE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>In process of time, the Deep Cut was finished,
and announced to be formally opened on a certain
day, when the tide should be favourable for
showing it off to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was thought that a damp would be cast
over the proceedings by the present unprosperous
state of the coal trade, which seemed to render it
less probable than it had at first appeared that
the undertaking would soon repay its expenses.
The war still continued, and with it the practice
of impressment; so that colliers could not be
manned but at a very high cost. Wages in
colliers were now just four times what were given
in king’s ships. The difficulty mentioned by
uncle Christoper of getting colliers worked up the
Thames was also greater than ever; and the price
of coal rose so much that the demand slackened,
week by week. This was an awkward state of
things in which to begin a grand new experiment;
but the cost of the Deep Cut had been already
incurred, and the only thing to be done was to
make use of it, as fast as possible. Some persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.79'>79</span>wondered that Mr. Otley, who loved a joke, did
not make use of this season of adversity for
ridiculing a scheme whose execution he had been
unable to prevent. No light sayings of his upon
the matter were going the round of his neighbourhood;
and such members of the Company as
had the honour of his acquaintance, were surprised
that they had not yet been jeered by him about
the large attendance they were likely to have at
the opening, from the great number of people
about the collieries who were out of employment.
But Mr. Otley was quite as loyally occupied in
another way—in attempting to draw tighter the
restraints of the apprenticeship laws, and to
extend the infliction to the flourishing towns
which had grown into their prosperous maturity
exempt from the privilege, or curse, (whichever
it might be called,) of a law of apprenticeship.
It was quite the fashion, just now, among loyal
men, to petition after the manner which the rector
had adopted; and an opposite fashion spread,
among those who had been tripped up in the
‘old paths,’ of going down to the origin of things,
and mounting up to their consequences. These
latter began to discover not only how impracticable
was the apprenticeship law of Elizabeth,
how nearly it went to subvert the common law,
how it could retain even a nominal force only by
evasion; but they saw that if parliament should
be prevailed on to enforce it afresh, the next
step of the loyal might be to revive the old
statutes, that he who should sell abroad sheep,
rams or lambs, should lose all he had, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.80'>80</span>part with his left hand, and for a second offence
suffer death; or that a like penalty should be
made once more to visit an exporter of fullers’
earth; or of tobacco-pipe clay, because such
clay is like fullers’ earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Mr. Otley was trotting about the
country, representing the blessings that arise
from compelling every merchant ship to have so
many apprentices and no more, and the advantage
of keeping businesses within bounds by allowing
the corporations of towns to regulate the number
of apprentices,—that the Sheffield cutler shall
take but one, the Norwich weaver only two,
hatters every where, at home and in the colonies,
only two,—while the rector was thus straining
his sight into the regions of times long past, he
seemed to have no leisure for observing what
was before his eyes. Long rope-walks were
extended beside the sluice; the boat-builder’s
mallet made itself heard from among the rocks;
the fisherman’s cottage began to show itself on
the narrow strip of beach below; and the last
finish was being given to the rail-road which led
to the sluice. If there had been no practical
evasion of corporation laws, this supply of skilled
labour would not have been in existence to
answer the demand. If all kinds of skilled
labour had been subjected to corporation laws,
there would have been no liberty to settle in a
new field, without the loss of such privileges as
would not have been risked on such an uncertainty
as the speculation offered at best.</p>

<p class='c001'>The day of opening was the brightest of April
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.81'>81</span>mornings; and it brought spectators from all
parts of the country. Long before the Company’s
train of carriages was looked for, the fruit and
gingerbread stalls were resounding with mirth
and gossip. Troops of little children, already as
black as if coal had been their plaything from
their birth, were accosting strangers, to ask for
a token to remember the day by.</p>

<p class='c001'>Business-like-looking men walked straight to
the Cut, and seemed to be computing its width
and depth,—most of them expressing great
admiration of the work. To the lover of beauty
there was much to admire, when he had turned
his back on the wooden bridge, and the gates,
the vehicles of those who came to see these gates
swing open, and the stalls which were but a
temporary feature of the landscape. The hewn
rock, raw and bright coloured as was its upper
part, was already more favourably tinted below
by its contact with the water. Small shell fish
were clustered upon it, and weed rested wherever
a ledge or crevice could be found. The water in
the inlet showed the purest green, over its deep
bottom of white sand, on which a star-fish here
and there was distinctly visible, and from which
the sea-anemone slowly rose, like a variegated
parachute, which astonished the watcher by its
tokens of being alive. Now and then a stray
fish came in by mistake, not being aware that
any sea path led so directly into the regions of
art. As such a poor wanderer darted from side
to side of the narrow inlet, striking against the
rock and bewildering itself, many a child shouted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.82'>82</span>in glee from the parapet, and ran to and fro to
watch till the fish had disposed of itself, either
out at sea once more, or beneath some friendly
shadow.</p>

<p class='c001'>These new operations must have been very
perplexing to the fishy tribes in general, which
might happen to pass that way. Not only was
there this treacherous Cut to beguile them
landwards, when they least dreamed of such a
destination, but there was a labyrinth at sea, in
the shape of the foundations of the new pier.
The young fry had not yet been taught by their
wiser parents (if indeed the parents knew any
better themselves) to avoid these piles, and the
perils that lurked among them: and young fry of
a more powerful species were already kneeling
on the beams of the pier, and catching, through
the interstices which were left between the planks,
a goodly prey of infant fish,—the greater part
of which were mercifully thrown over from the
end of the pier. Flags waved from every conspicuous
point of the rocks and the works. A
medley of music came from the midst of the
throng about the parapet; and all bore the
appearance of a new settlement as completely as
if a slice of an American shore had been once
more annexed to his British Majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the parapet sat one of the last persons who
might have been expected to join in the festivity—little
Tim. His mother had taken him to
the ferry-house, to know if any of the family
thought of going, and would take her poor boy,
who was fond of doing what other people did, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.83'>83</span>he could not see what they saw. Walter meant
to go, and he readily took charge of Tim. Effie
did not quite like the tone in which this request
was made. There was a despondency in it which
alarmed her, especially as she knew that there
was, just now, a scarcity of work at the pit-mouth,
and low wages to the women and boys
employed there. Mrs. Eldred made so much
difficulty about accepting the little she could do
for her, that to press more upon her was certainly
to offend her. But Walter feared she was in
great poverty; and when he observed how she
was wasted and worn with long looking for her
husband’s return, the apprehension suddenly
crossed him that she had some design to get rid
of her miseries in the most fearful way in which
impatience exhibits itself. The idea was but
momentary, however, as she had immediately referred
to things to be done by her own hands,
and to be told when she should have more time
to stay with her daughter. Tim had quitted her
apron, (which he continued to hold for guidance,
great boy as he was,) surrendered her for Walter,
in the prospect of this trip, and was now seated
on the parapet, with Walter’s arm about him,
and apparently enjoying the bustle as much as
those who more reasonably came into it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me run along by the wall with them!”
said he, struggling to be set down. “Let me
run with those boys!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Better not, Tim. They are only running
to see a fish that swims away faster than they
can follow.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.84'>84</span>“I know that; but I can always run along
by a wall.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And away he would go, his brother-in-law
keeping an eye upon him, to see how he defended
himself from the knocks and pushes he
was exposing himself to. He managed very
well, always being one of the first to turn when
others were about to do so, from his quickness in
gathering up the guiding remarks of those about
him. He had generally a word for Walter when
he came back towards him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Walter, have you spoken to Adam yet?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Adam, no; you don’t suppose Adam is here,
do you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, but I do. I am sure it was his voice I
just heard from over yonder. You will see him
soon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And away went Tim again. The next time it
was,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The show will soon be here now, Walter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because of the tide coming up. Don’t you
hear it,—lap, lap, lap?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you know it is not going down—if
you can hear it at all, in this din?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, it is quite a different sound, going out;
a—a—I can’t tell you what; but quite a different
sound.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor boy!” said a by-stander. “I wish
you could see how pretty the water looks, with all
the gay flags above it, and the smart people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you,” said Tim, and he shuffled off
once more.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.85'>85</span>“Do you think that is the best way of comforting
people for such a loss as that poor boy’s?”
asked Walter, who was not the person to ask
such a question, unless roused on poor Tim’s
behalf.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, it is what one feels, you see; and
what one hears people say every day,” replied the
man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, that’s true; but I don’t think it is the
kindest thing to say. If you can give him a
knowledge of what is going on, it is all very well;
but not merely to put him in mind uselessly that
he cannot enjoy it. At least, such is my rule.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And a very good one, I have no doubt. To
be sure, to make it one’s own case for a minute,
one can hardly fancy what answer one would
make.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! it is not every one that could say, like
Tim, ‘Thank you,’ and directly run off to amuse
himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed there are but few; and the great
thing is to find out how they take their misfortune
themselves. There are some that look as
if they would knock you down if you do but come
near the matter with them; and others shake all
over, or put on a sort of affectation that is worse;
and some like to talk and be talked to about it;
and others (and they are the wisest) just take it
simply and naturally, so as to remove one’s difficulty,
almost entirely.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tim is one of these last,” said Walter, patting
the boy’s head, as he came near.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What am I, Walter?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.86'>86</span>“Heating yourself sadly, with getting so
pushed about.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, I’ll get cool when the show comes, and
I sit on the wall again. But if you want to go
somewhere else, I’ll come any minute; only, the
water is getting so high, it would be a pity to go
away and lose our place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So it would. Play away, as you like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just as if he could see! He talks about the
show like any other boy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, and you would be surprised to hear the
account he will give his sister when we go home.
He picks up a world of odd things that we let
slip; and that, and his great mistakes together,
make his stories very strange ones sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet he seems easy enough to treat and deal
with. A kind heart and a little thought may do
all that he wants from us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And all that the others want that you mentioned
just now. If we let our good will have
its way, without being held back and twisted by
shyness and doubt, we shall be sure to please
people who depend upon kindness more than any
others. The only thing I cannot pardon is the
giving way to shyness when——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet I should guess you to be shy yourself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, so I am; and yet I should be more
struck with any body being shy about helping
Tim in his little devices than he himself would,
though he has no shyness. It always strikes me
that when these sufferers have had so much more
awkwardness to get over, it is not to be pardoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.87'>87</span>that we should renew their trouble with ours.
But where is Tim gone now? Slipped away in
a minute! He cannot be far off; but what were
we about?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter cast an involuntary fearful glance down
the inlet, where nothing was happening, however,
to disturb the solitary sea-gull which was very
quietly balancing itself on the surface.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Were ye looking for the little blind lad?”
asked a woman near. “He met with a friend
in the throng, and they went off together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another minute, Tim merged from behind
the awning of a stall, holding Adam by the right
hand, and a huge orange in the left.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tim said you were here,” observed Walter,
“and I did not believe him. He heard you half
an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tim, what did you hear me saying?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not catch your words, but I was sure
it was your voice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am glad to see you buying oranges, Adam.
I suppose this orange came out of yonder rope-walk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not it; and it is the last I am likely to buy;
and I would not have got it for any one but Tim.
I am not going to lose my settlement, I can tell
you. The place that took such pains to settle me
may keep me till there is work for us all again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Keep you! How?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no lack of means. There are the
rates, and fine corporation funds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And plenty of your sort of work wanted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.88'>88</span>be done here, it seems. There is a great call for
rope-makers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And a great call for work among the rope-makers
belonging to the town. But we of the
town hold back, you observe, to see who will
come forward first and lose his privileges. For
my part, I mean to hold back till I can be a master,
and have apprentices, and do things in proper
style; and then Tim shall turn the wheel,
and get money like other lads. Will you,
Tim?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter allowed that it was a thing out of the
question to give up a settlement in a corporate
town in exchange for one in a district like this,
whose prosperity must long remain precarious.
He scarcely saw how this precariousness was to
be remedied if there was a dearth of workmen to
do the business essential to the improvement of
the place, while there was elsewhere a superabundance
of the very sort of workmen wanted.
If it was necessary to give very high wages
here for work which received very low wages
elsewhere, it was difficult to perceive how any
fair competition was to be maintained, and the
subsistence fund duly husbanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose,” said he, “you may thank the
law that gave you your apprentice privileges for
the low wages you have had of late, Adam?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes; plenty to thank that law for. People
generally complain that it raises wages higher
than natural. I am ready to testify to its sinking
them lower.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.89'>89</span>“Both are right, I fancy. Wages are raised,
as said, by crafts being confined to fewer hands
than need be; and this mischief goes on from
generation to generation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, yes; if they first make it necessary to
be an apprentice, and then forbid the taking
more than a certain number of apprentices, it is
easy to see how many willing folks will be
hindered of entering into a trade; and those that
are in it may keep up wages as long as their
handiwork is wanted. But when——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! when the balance turns, and times are
bad, wages may fall to the very lowest point, or
cease, if the craftsmen are hindered from withdrawing
some of their number, and turning their
hands to some other trade. It does seem an
uncommonly stupid plan, to be sure; and when
men were beginning to get the better of it, and
outgrow and step over it, what a strange thing it
seems that a clergyman, like Mr. Otley, should
be doing his best to fasten us down under it
again, tighter than ever!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And at the very time that his lady is sending
here and sending there for articles that she
cannot content herself to buy in her native place.
If the gentleman does his best to prevent his
neighbours working out of corporation bounds,
the least his lady can do is to employ those neighbours,
instead of buying what she wants from a
distance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think so. But what puts such a fancy into
her head?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She complains that the workmanship of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.90'>90</span>articles is inferior at home to what it is in newer
places. And if it is, who is to blame for it but
those who meddle to spoil competition, and persuade
their own workmen that they have a sure
dependence otherwise than on their own skill?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have heard of such a thing happening,
in some strict corporate towns, as the very
gentlemen of the corporation themselves passing
by their own people to get their work done in
the out-lying villages, and having it brought in
secretly. Such men are guilty, one way or another,
it seems to me. Either let them bestir
themselves to have trade allowed to go free, or
submit themselves to the restraints they put on
others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are full as foolish as wrong, however;
for what do they do by such management but
bring so many more paupers on themselves to
be maintained? It won’t do to try to persuade
their idle workmen to go elsewhere. The masters
elsewhere do not like hiring so as to give a settlement,
any better than we like being so hired.
We stick like burrs to those who fastened us upon
them, and they may make what they can of us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder what they think of all this in other
countries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In America (our seamen tell me) they laugh
mightily at us for tying our legs, and then complaining
that we cannot walk. In America, they
have none of this mischief of trade corporations
and apprenticeships; and how are they the
worse for their absence? If American handiworks,
and the handiworks of our own new, free towns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.91'>91</span>are better (as every one knows they are) than
those of our corporate towns, what can we conclude
but that corporate restraints are bad things?
I have half a mind sometimes to step away into
a free country myself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A free country! As if England was not a
free country!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is freer than most; and so much freer
than it used to be, that I have hopes of our
grandchildren seeing themselves as unfettered in
their callings as the Americans. But just now,
none of us are practically free. Everybody is
ready enough to call out about poor Cuddie; and
with just reason. But my case, though not so
hard an one as his, is not altogether to be overlooked
beside it. Instead of being forcibly
turned from a labour I like to one that I did not
choose, there is a moral force used to prevent
my turning from an unprofitable occupation to
a profitable one. Now, the labour of a man is
his birthright,—his sole property; and any power
that comes between him and its exercise is
tyranny. Never mind how it may be softened
down, and disused, and in some places nearly
forgotten. As long as there is such a power
lying ready to be put forth against the labourer,
that labourer is not a free man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“These powers will grow less and less mischievous
as time rolls on. No corporation in
the world can stand against the will of the public
to be supplied with what they want. There will
be apprentices enough in Norwich and Sheffield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.92'>92</span>to keep the trade going as it should, if the world
really wants more knives and stuffs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes; and look what a list of great men
we have got,—no thanks to our trade rules!
but in spite of them. Think of Arkwright, and
Brindley, and Brunel!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And Smeaton, and Rennie, and Watt, and
Fergusson, and Hunter. These were never apprenticed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, nor many more that have made themselves
a great name. My doubt is whether they
would have had such a name if they had been kept
listless and longing,—or downright idle, from
having no interest in their seven years’ work.
If,—I will not say I,—but many others, had
been kept at our education a year or two longer,
who knows what we might have done in the
world?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Especially if you had been born in some of
the spirited new towns, which were little more
than villages a hundred years ago, and now rank
far before York, and Canterbury, and Norwich,
and Lichfield. As for London itself, the most
blessed day in its existence will be when its hundred
companies dissolve their monopolies, if not
themselves. I venture to say this, because we
have before our eyes what has happened elsewhere.
Look at Spain, now full of corporation
glories; and France, where industry and art
began to thrive from the day that her corporation
and apprenticeship laws were swept away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In France, I’m told, they have made an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.93'>93</span>experiment of everything, from the worst meddling
to perfect freedom. I do not know that it
was ever settled there, as it is in India, that every
man must follow his father’s profession, but they
did some things almost as wise, in old times.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And some with such good intentions as to
afford a fine warning against governments meddling
at all with production. In one sense, to
be sure, governments influence production by
whatever they do; (which should make them
very careful about every step they take.) But I
now mean direct interference. It seemed only
prudent and kind to the people to make rules
about felling trees, some parts of the soil being
absolutely good for nothing unless they had trees
in the neighbourhood to encourage moisture;
yet the first consequence of these rules was to
prevent people planting trees.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is good; but the story of the cockchafers
is better. Do not you know that story?
Some district abroad, in Switzerland, I think,
was plagued with cockchafers; and to get rid of
them, the government obliged every landholder
to furnish certain quantities, in proportion to the
land he held. The landholders paid the poor
people for collecting them; and after a time
it was found out that cockchafers were regularly
imported in sacks from the other side of the
lake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very good. But there was one instance
among many of positive loss in France, through
meddling with industry, which is a fine warning
to such men as Otley, if they would take it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.94'>94</span>Before the revolution broke the corporation fetters
of the workpeople, there could be no manufacture
of japanned hardware in France. The
process requiring the art and tools of several
different trades, and that a man should be free
of them all, this kind of production was left to
strangers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is very like passing a law that there
shall be no new inventions; or that every man
shall follow his father’s occupation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the practice of these lawmakers agreed
with their principle. Did you ever see an Argand
lamp?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, yes. Not so good as some gas lamps.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But yet giving out three times as much light
at the same cost as any lamps that were known
before. Argand was publicly persecuted by the
company of tinners, locksmiths, and ironmongers,
who disputed his right to make lamps.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if they would do that, they would most
likely not admit him of their company if he had
chosen to trouble himself to canvass for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then there was Lenoir, the great French
philosophical instrument maker. He set up a
little furnace to heat his metals in; and straightway
came certain of the Founders’ Company to
pull it down; and Lenoir was obliged to appeal
to the king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There might just as well have been a hot-bed
company that would not have let you grow
cucumbers without their help; or a scare-crow
company to prevent your hanging up your old
coat among the cherry-trees.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.95'>95</span>“And here comes a company that would give
you plenty of rope-making to do, if you would
leave your privileges behind you, and bring your
skill to their market.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye; and then as soon as people at home have
forgotten me, and my place there is fairly filled
by some one else, and there begins to be a talk of
business falling off, I may be warned out of this
field by some frightened old woman of a church-warden,
or some spiteful overseer, who will bid
me be gone to my own place. No, no. The
company must make a hue and cry for rope-makers
indeed, before they will get me to pass
out of bounds. Yet, trespassing out of bounds
was what I best liked to do, when I was not my
own master.—How bravely they come on, in
their open carriages, with their flags and their
boughs! Well! really it is a pretty sight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do look at Tim, with his oak bough as big
as himself! He must be a fine fellow that gave
it him,—that tall lad who keeps a hand on Tim’s
shoulder to guide him. I’ll go and take his
place. It is not fair that a stranger should have
the trouble of poor Tim.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I think it would be a charity in me
to offer myself to some of the gentlemen as a
handshaker. Did you ever see? How the folks
are reaching up to shake hands! The black
pitmen, and the keelmen, with their brown hats
in the other hand, and their wives holding up the
little ones that will be pitmen and keelmen some
time or other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And Mr. Severn too! Look! there he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.96'>96</span>on the box of yonder barouche, smiling and
nodding so cheerfully, thin and worn as he looks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye: when we make our many trades as free
as we boast we already are, Mr. Severn will get
something like a recompense of his toils. In
those days, if he but lives to see them, it will
happen always as it happens by accident to-day,
that he will be full in view of the people that are
always ready to welcome him, while Otley slinks
away, to follow his own devices out of sight.—Stand
back! stand back, and make way for
them! Now is your time to look to Tim!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The gates were now beginning gently to open
one way, and the little bridge to swing round the
other way. The din was hushed,—music, laughter,
children’s cries, men’s shouts, the whining
of dogs, and the tramp of horses. All was still,
except the ripple and lapse of water, as a thousand
eyes were bent to watch the first vessel that
ever passed this way, noiselessly turning the point
from the open sea, and gliding along the Cut.
It was the first time that the gazers had ever had
an opportunity of looking down into a vessel so
immediately beneath their feet, (except during the
few moments required for shooting a bridge.)
It was a singular sight,—some of the tackle
almost sweeping the rocks as it passed, and its
bulk casting a black moving shadow on the bed
of pure sand below the green water. The smutty-faced
crew looked up to the thousand eager faces
far above their heads, and gave a silent signal
that all should be ready to cheer when the gates
should be passed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.97'>97</span>“There it goes!” said Tim, softly, as he sat
on the parapet, with Walter’s arm about his
waist, and the vessel passing just beneath him.
“There it goes!” he whispered again, turning
his head in due proportion to its progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Does it graze the rocks or the sand?” asked
Walter, wondering at the boy’s accurate knowledge
of what was going on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No: but it makes a great stir in the air. I
feel the wind upon my face. Tell me when I
may speak, Walter. I have something to tell
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A vehement shout now rose on all hands, to
put an end to Tim’s scruples about speaking
amidst a dead silence. All the seamen present
pushed, cuffed, and scrambled to get a good
sight of the vessel’s farther progress when she
had passed the gates. While the rivalry of blue
jackets and gruff voices was going on, Tim
uttered his strange communication.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Walter! Walter! I am sure Cuddie is here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear boy, what a fancy!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! it seems an odd thing; but I heard
Cuddie’s voice, just as I heard Adam’s before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know Adam’s voice well, hearing it so
often as you do. But, remember, it is four years
since you heard Cuddie’s; and I am afraid it
may be more than four years before you hear it
again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Well! Tim thought it better to be only <em>almost</em>
sure.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides,” said Walter, “there is no king’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.98'>98</span>ship near us now. All the king’s ships are at
the wars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tim had no more to say. The next thing
that happened was an outcry on the skirts of the
crowd. Everybody thought it was an accident,
and rushed towards the spot, or, in order to inquire,
stopped others who were doing so. It was
only some thief or quarrelsome person, or other
kind of vagabond, that the constables and their
helpers had failed to catch. The fellow had got off.
Who was he? what had he done? everybody asked.
Nobody at a distance could tell, and nobody near
would tell. It was hinted that, whatever the offence
might be, it was of some popular kind;
and that the offender had been helped by the
people to escape. The incident took a firm hold
of Tim’s imagination. He cared no more about
what took place during the next hour than the
many spectators present who belonged to the
class that, having eyes, see not. When the
parapet was left to him and Walter, when the
tide had gone down, when the train of carriages
had disappeared, he was still plying his brother-in-law
with questions about his conjectures: and
when at length advised to go to sleep in his unaccustomed
lodging in a public-house, he went
on to weary the sleepy Walter with—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should think he will lie in the fields to-night,
while we are so snug and comfortable
here? If he has murdered anybody, perhaps a
ghost will come and scare him? I wonder whether
his wife or his mother know where he is? Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.99'>99</span>foot that stirs, he will think it is the constable
come to take him up. Do you know, I have
been thinking whether that might not have been
Cuddie’s ghost that I heard to-day. They say
many seamen are shot in these wars, and if we
should find that Cuddie was killed just at the
very time——What o’clock do you think it was?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter now replied in no sleepy tone. He
was not a believer in ghosts, but his mind was
interested, more than he could justify, in Tim’s
persuasion that he had heard Cuddie speak, Tim
was so seldom mistaken about these matters!
Yet the war was still prolonged, and if poor
Cuddie was not ere this at the bottom of the sea,
he must be too far off on its surface for the fairy
Fine-Ear to have caught the tones of his voice,
if Fine-Ear had been this day among the crowd.</p>

<h3 id='ch3.6' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br> <br>SLEEPING AND WAKING.</h3>

<p class='c017'>While Walter was settling this matter with
his reason, Effie was sauntering in his garden,—his
garden, of late as much improved in
beauty and productiveness as the coal-trade was
depressed. Sorry as Effie was that her mother
was not able to get full work, she could not help
rejoicing in the vigour and verdure of Walter’s
favourites. Her half wish to go away had subsided
into perfect contentment with remaining,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.100'>100</span>though uncle Christopher still abode with them.
His contempt for them, in a religious view, signified
less as they gathered more years upon their
shoulders. It became easier to act as if his censorious
eye was not upon them, and to take whatever
he might do and say as being his way.
He enjoyed exceedingly all the creature comforts
that Effie put before him, though he could not
think of spoiling her by any appearance of acknowledgment
of her care, till she should allow
him to cater for her spiritual good. He ate his little
fowl, or sipped his evening cordial, full of pitying
amazement that Effie would not let him lead her
devotions, or grant her a gracious permission to
sing psalms with himself and his few chosen
friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a prayer-meeting of this kind which
kept Effie abroad late this evening. The common
room was occupied, and it would have appeared
ungracious to shut herself up in her
chamber. She therefore carried her work into
the arbour after tea, and sat sewing, and looking
abroad, and plucking little sprigs of one fragrant
thing or another, till every bird within hearing
had dropped off from the choir, and left nothing
to be heard but a stray grasshopper, and nothing
to be done but to cease poring over her stitching
and take a turn in the green alley. There she
turned and turned again, looking for the young
moon and her attendant star among the fleecy
clouds that now parted opportunely, and now
melted into a mass, just when she wanted to see
what was behind them. Thinking that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.101'>101</span>could catch a reflection of the crescent in a bend
of the river, she ran up the hedge, and leaned
over as far as she could, without falling, head
foremost, into the ditch on the other side. She
was very near so falling when a rustle in the
same ditch startled her. She jumped back, expecting
to see something follow her. Nothing
appeared, and she satisfied herself that it was
only a dog or a stray pig, or a sheep about to
leave a tribute of wool on the briars, in return
for a bite of particularly delicate grass. She
turned again along the alley, and amused herself
with planting erect any props that might
have declined from the perpendicular. While
doing so, she perceived the faint, yellow light
of a glow-worm on the bank, which her husband
gave her for the indulgence of her own fancies
about primroses and blue hyacinths. Eagerly she
kneeled down to watch the creature, and played
with it for some time, now with a gentle finger-tip,
and now with a stout blade of grass. The psalm
from within doors meanwhile came, softened by
distance, into a not unpleasing music. Effie’s
mind and heart joined in this music more than her
uncle would readily have believed. She invariably
laid aside amusements and light thoughts when
it reached her; and sympathized all the better
in the devotions of the company from their
psalms being stripped by distance of all that
appeared to her harsh and unduly familiar in
their sentiments and language. She now instantly
arose, leaving the worm to find its way
back to its covert; but—straight before her—stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.102'>102</span>a man, peeping at her through the hedge.
He ducked, the moment he saw that he was observed,
and she could get no answer to her questions
and remarks—“What do you want?—If
you are looking for the ferry, it is just
below, to your right hand.—If you want our
people, you had better come round to the gate.”
She retreated towards the house, to shelter herself
under the sounds that issued thence. She had
no fear for her safety while in such neighbourhood;
but she pondered the probability of the
garden being robbed. There was little in it at
present worth removal; but she thought she
should do what she had done before when left
in the guardianship of her husband’s goods—sit
up in the star-light, and look out upon the garden,
till her uncle, who was an early riser, should
be heard stirring in the morning. This measure
she presently decided upon; and the decision
brought in so many thoughts of chill, and drowsiness,
and startings, and nervous fancies,—with
all of which her watchings had made her well
acquainted,—that when she went back to the
arbour for her work and implements, she
snatched them up as if a thief had been in hiding
there, and fled home as if he were following at
her heels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Uncle Christopher had just left the house with
his guests, in order to ferry them over to their
own bank of the river. Before putting the circle
of chairs in their places, and depositing the
hymn-book on its shelf, Effie closed and locked
both doors of the dwelling. She had not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.103'>103</span>seated at her work a minute before there was a
tap, and then a push at the door which opened into
the garden.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who is there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Effie, Effie, let me in!” said a low voice
which thrilled through her. For the first time
since her childhood, a superstitious terror seized
her; and she sat staring, and neither spoke nor
moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lattice was not quite fastened, and she saw
it open, and a face appear within it which produced
the same effect upon her as the voice had
done.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, are ye Cuddie, or are ye not?” cried she,
shading her eyes from the candlelight, and gazing
intently.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I am Cuddie,” said he mournfully, as
he entered by the lattice. “But it is hard to believe
you are Effie, so unwilling to let your own
brother into your own house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was said,—not like the Cuddie of old,
but so like her mother, that Effie no longer
doubted.</p>

<p class='c001'>She poured out a multitude of questions,—Whence
did he come? When did he arrive?
Was he here for good, to follow his own business
again? And had her father returned also?</p>

<p class='c001'>He put aside all her questions, desiring only,
for the present, that she would help him to enter
the house when uncle Christopher was gone to
bed. Uncle Christopher would be back in five
minutes, and there was no time to lose in settling
how——</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.104'>104</span>“But you are not going away before you have
spoken to me, or given one look that I dare to
rest upon. Why, Cuddie——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Effie, I am not going to meet uncle
Christopher; I can tell you that. There he lay,
muttering his cant, the night I was carried off,
and did not so much as put a foot out of bed
to help me. He may talk of how many souls
he has saved. He has lost one, I can tell him;
and if I ever meet him,—and it will be only by
chance,—I shall tell him——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There he is!” cried Effie, hearing the rattle
of the chain by which the boat was fastened.
Cuddie instantly let himself out by the back door,
intimating that he should return to be admitted, as
soon as his uncle could be supposed asleep. This
event was not long in happening, as Effie was
not, this evening, very lavish of remarks which
might tempt him to linger over his pipe and glass.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Cuddie re-entered from the garden, his
first act was to desire his sister to fasten the door
at the foot of the stairs, and hang up blinds
against both windows, he standing in the shadow
till this was done. Effie timidly objected to
blinding the front window which looked down
upon the ferry; it was not yet too late for the
possibility of passengers. This seemed to serve
as a new reason; and she was obliged to hang up
her shawl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you want to know the reason,” whispered
her brother,—“I am a deserter. Hush! No
noise! or you will be the death of me, as Adam
was near being this morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.105'>105</span>“Won’t you sit down?” said Effie,—as she
might have spoken to an intruder from Bedlam.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Effie, you always used to say what you felt,
and all that you felt. Are you changed too?
Come; tell me what you are thinking.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think I am in a dream, and do not know
whether you be Cuddie, or a fancy of my own.
O, Cuddie, I have always loved you next to
Walter, and looked upon you as the pride and
hope of the family; and as often as I have
started from sleep, these four years past, it
has been with dreaming over again your being
taken at dead of night, and especially your slipping
down the cable. The worst moments I have
had from the time you rowed away from this
ferry, that bright evening, are those between
sleeping and waking, when I saw you cold and
altered before me, and I could not by any means
make you smile. I never,—no I never believed
this last would come true. And now,—and now,”
she uttered between her sobs, “you know what
I am thinking about.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cuddie cast himself on the ground, laid his
head on her knee, as he had done in many a
childish trouble, weeping so that he could not for
long be persuaded to look up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not altogether altered, I see,” said
Effie, striving to speak cheerfully. “You are not
come back the round-faced, weather-brown seaman
I always fancied you would be, but instead,
far too much as if you had been famished. Yet
your heart is the same.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.106'>106</span>“O, yes. But you have known want lately,
and you are discouraged. I much fear you have
known want.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis not that which has bowed my spirit.
Effie, I am altogether heart-broken.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not dare to say that. We must bear
whatever Providence——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it is not Providence that has done it; it
is my king and country,” cried Cuddie, starting
up, the flush fading from his face, and leaving it
of a deadly paleness. “If it had been the will
of Providence, Effie, to take a limb from me, I
would have made my way home on crutches, with
a stout heart, and none of you should have heard
a bitter word from me. If lightning from above
had scorched out my eyes, I would have taken
Tim for an example, and been thankful through
the live-long day. If the fever had laid me low
on shipboard, I would have been a man to the
last, knowing that my corpse would make the
plunge before midnight. But to have one’s king
and country against one is what is enough to
break any man’s heart that has ever loved either
of them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure it is. What have they been
doing to you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Things that I do not hold myself bound to
bear, as if they were done according to the will
of Providence, and not against it. They first
turned my very heart within me with carrying
me away, as if I had been a black slave; carrying
me away from all I cared about, and the
occupation I could most willingly follow. Then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.107'>107</span>when I had little spirit for my work, and many
bitter thoughts to distract me in it, and hurt my
temper, the next thing they must do is to flog
me. What surprises you in that? Don’t you
know that impressment brings flogging? Carry
away a man as a slave, and next thing you must
whip him as a thief, and that brings hanging like
a dog. Yes, they flogged me, and my head grew
down on my breast from the time that scornful
eyes were for ever upon me. This morning I
have been hunted by my countrymen,—by many
an one that I knew when nobody dared look
scornfully on me. It was my own brother’s
doing that they were set on. My country has
but one thing more to do with me; and that is
to make away with me for desertion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you do not mean to do it yourself,
thank God!” cried Effie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, Effie. I have been tempted many a
time, from the night I slipped down the cable,
as you mentioned, till this very afternoon, when
I hid in an old coal-pit, and was but too near
throwing myself below. I shall make a trial of
what is to be done by going where there is no
king, and where one may forget one’s country.
There is not a saint in heaven that could make
me forgive them; but there may be ways of
forgetting them. I will make the trial in America.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then we shall lose the best brother, and my
mother the child she has looked to through every
thing, and your king a servant that may ill be
spared during this war.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.108'>108</span>“Never mind the king. If he knows no better
how to get his subjects to serve him——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush, Cuddie! You a seaman, and talk so
of your king!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not a seaman now. However, say the
country, if you will: if she knows no better how
to get served than by first making slaves of her
free-born men, let her do as well as she can when
they leave her to turn against her. As soon as
she takes a man’s birthright from him, his duty
ceases. Mine was at an end when they carried
me off, neck and heels, and turned me, in one
hour, from a brave-hearted boy into a mean-souled
man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes, I say; but though it was so, they
had gained no right to disgrace me. That flogging
might possibly have been thought justifiable
by some people, if I had entered the service of
my own free will: as I did not, they had no more
right to flog me than the showman yonder has to
goad the lion he enticed into his trap. If that
lion should ever get out a paw to revenge himself,
it would go hard with me to help the human
brute.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie was confounded. In casting about for
an argument wherewith to stop this method of
discourse, she could find none out of the Bible.
Christian forgiveness of injuries was her plea.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is the difference, certainly, between
the lion and me,” said Cuddie: “the Bible is
out of the question in his case. It shall be
minded in my own, so far as this:—I will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.109'>109</span>lift a hand against my country, and I will go
where I may possibly learn to forgive her; but
I cannot do it here, Effie,—even if my life were
safe, I could not do it here. My country loses a
stout-bodied, willing-hearted member, and I lose
all I have ever lived for; but there the mischief
shall stop, for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, for you; but how many more are there
lost in like manner? I think some devil, in the
service of our country’s enemies, has come to
blind our eyes, and harden our hearts, and make
us a sad wonder for the times that are to come.
Will men believe such a story as yours,—such
an one as my father’s,—a hundred years hence?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, they will easily believe, because they
will look back to what the service now is, and
how it is regarded, and contrast these things with
what, I trust, will be the state of things in their
day. They will look back and see that merchant
seamen are now paid more than they need be,
because naval seamen are paid so much less than
they ought to be, and made subject to violence.
If, as I hope, in those days, the one service will
be as desirable as the other, (or the king’s, perhaps,
the most so of the two,) it will be found
that our colliers will man a navy at the first call;
and then men will believe that when it was otherwise,
there was some fearful cause of wrong that
came in between the king and his seamen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It does seem, indeed, as if there was no lack
of loyalty among our people, when their minds
are not turned from their king by some strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.110'>110</span>act; and we hear few complaints of the service
from those who go willingly to it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is none that would be liked so well, if
it had fair play. Besides the honour of keeping
off the enemy, and the glory of helping to preserve
one’s country, there is so much variety, and
so many adventures, and so many hundred thousand
eyes looking on, that a sea-life in his Majesty’s
service has many charms. But honour
is a mockery to one’s heart, unless it is won by
the heart; and what are varieties of adventure
to him whose body may be roving, but whose
spirit sits, like a gloomy, unseen ghost, for ever
by his own fire-side?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He who goes of his own will has most likely
made provision for those he has left behind; and
then the thought of them will come only when
it can animate him, and never to discourage
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, you should see the difference between
the volunteers and certain slaves like me!—how
the one are impatient with the captain till he gets
boldly out in search of the enemy; and how the
other would fain have the vessel creep for ever
along the shore, that he might have a chance of
stealing out, and forgetting his present disgraces
by daring a worse reproach still. You should
see the difference of their patience on the watch,
and of their courage before a battle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure I should not care to show bravery
in a danger I was thrust into against my will, as
I should in one that it was my own choice to
face. I should be apt to get away, if I could.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.111'>111</span>“My wish would have been just the opposite,
that there might be an end of me, Effie, if I had
happened to be in a battle since I was flogged:
but the battles I was in happened first; and if I
was not a downright coward, I had no spirit to
fight as a freeman would. It cooled my blood,
and kept down my heart, to remember the night
when they took me in my sleep to defend others
when I was myself defenceless.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it was so with you,—you, who always
used to walk first when, as children, we had to
pass neighbour Topham’s bull,—you, that were
ready to go down doubtful places in the mine
when nobody else dared, and that brought out
the soldier, just drowning in the current by Cullercoat
Sands,—if it was so with you, how much
more it must happen with others, not naturally
so brave! But, Cuddie, do sit down quietly, and
tell me, as if you were telling of being punished
for bird-nesting, what it was that they blamed
you for on board ship.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Blamed me! They——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes—I know; but what was it for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did nothing well, all the time I was there.
Whatever might be going on, I was always thinking
of getting away;—just the same, whether I
was on watch, or going into the middle of the
fight, or hiding my face in the blanket, when laid
by under my dog punishment. There was enough
to flog me for, if the quality of my service had
been all that was looked to.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You that did everything well that you set
your hand to, from the time you were a child!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.112'>112</span>But the getting away you managed cleverly, I
dare say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A good many contrive to do that, notwithstanding
all the difficulties that are put in the way
of desertion, and the punishment that visits it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That punishment cannot always take place,
if so many desert. There would be a constant
putting to death.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, yes; considering that above five thousand
able-bodied, and four thousand ordinary
seamen have deserted within two years, the execution
of the whole is a sight that men would be
rather unwilling that angels should look upon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mercy, mercy! Only think of them all in
one crowd before a judge, pleading how they
were torn, many of them, from their busy homes,
and that these same homes were the temptation
to desert.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Think of them before another kind of judgment-seat,
Effie. Where would the balance of
crime be laid then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think no one would dare to carry there any
quarrels that grew up out of war,” Effie replied.
“Whatever noise of war there may be on this
earth, I fancy all will be glad to keep utter
silence upon it in another state.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, if they could. But how is it to be kept
out of knowledge? How am I to account for
my temper being bitter, that once was kindly; and
my habits being lazy, that once were brisk; and
my life being short and troublesome to everybody,
that might have been long and busy for others’
good; and my death being fearful, like an eclipse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.113'>113</span>when it might have been as the shutting in of the
summer twilight? How am I to account for all
this, without any plea of going out to war on the
high seas? Why do you look at me so, Effie?
I cannot bear being so looked at.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie had often tried to fancy the aspect and
demeanour of persons under sentence of death;
but she had never imagined anything so awful as
the lot seemed to be when it sat upon her brother.
To have seen his corpse stretched before her would
not have been more strange than to look on his
familiar face, to listen to his accustomed voice,
and to think that this motion and this sound were
awaiting extinction, while the thinking part was
fluctuating between this world and the next, not
in the frame of calm faith which abides the summons
of its Maker, but in the restless mood which
attends upon the tyranny of man. Effie had seen
her brother once awaiting death as the issue of
an illness. What she had then beheld caused her
heart now to sink on perceiving the starting eye
and curled lip, which told her that her brother
was a less religious man than he had been,—less
humble, less strong, less hopeful, less thoughtful
for others than before. She was not fully aware
of the difference of the cases,—how darkly God’s
agency is shrouded in the gloom of man’s injustice;
how the sufferer’s whole nature is outraged
by dependence upon his fellow-man for the
breath of life; and how infinitely the agony of
such outrage transcends the throes of dissolution.
The humblest convict may feel this, though he may
not be able to express it in words, as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.114'>114</span>noblest patriot that ever encountered martyrdom;
and it may be this sense of outrage that parches
the tongue and enfeebles the knees of one, while
it strings the nerves of another on the way to the
scaffold; while both may equally disregard the
parting convulsion, and long rather than dread
to know “the grand secret.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no, Cuddie, you do not mean that you
who sit there are doomed to be laid in the cold
ground so soon, unless you can banish yourself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do; and for a token—you must either help
me away this very hour, or see me carried off to
death, as one of the doomed five thousand. I
tell you I was nearly caught this day. If it had
not been for an acquaintance, more thoughtful
than Adam, (who spoke out my name the moment
he saw me,) I should have been beyond
hope at this hour. The whisper passed along,
however,—‘a poor deserter,’—and they opened
a way for me, and blocked up the enemy in a
crowd, and then gave out that it was only a petty
thief they were running after; and in this manner
I got off for the time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so you will again. God will not let
such as you so perish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall not tempt the risk further by staying.
God forgive me for saying so! but I cannot, and
I will not, so die.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush, hush! What would uncle Christopher,
what would all religious people say, if they
heard such a word from you as that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They might say that if one man presumes
to declare ‘You shall die at my bidding, for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.115'>115</span>crime invented by such as myself,’ another man
may, without presumption, say, ‘I will not die
for such a cause;’ and that he may, with as little
presumption, do his utmost peaceably to make
good his words. I will be gone this very hour, to
make good my word.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our poor mother!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not tell her that I have been here: she
will be for ever hearing the whoop of my hunters,
and fancying my death-groans at midnight. Let
her suppose me fighting creditably, like any
honest volunteer, till you hear what becomes of
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And can you be so near, and yet——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes; I can do many things that you would
have sworn, when we last parted, that I never
could. You do not know, I dare say, what it is
to grow careless of those one most loved,—to be
able to pass lightly near a mother’s door, on
one’s way to a new world, and not look in.
You——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cuddie, what brought you to see me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What would you say if it was to get Walter
to give me a coat that might disguise me, and
you to supply me with food, that might prevent
my needing to speak to any one on the road?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall not believe any part of your story, if
you dare to say so much that is false,” said Effie,
rising, however, to see what her humble hospitality
could furnish. “I did hope, indeed, that
there were some, besides your mother, that you
would have thought worth inquiring after.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw your husband and the others to-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.116'>116</span>you know, except uncle Christopher, and him I
will look upon now;” and he snatched the candle
to go up stairs. His sister stopped him eagerly,
to inquire whether he had really seen her husband.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, that did I. Adam, as I told you, I
saw full enough of. And Tim, poor child, was
telling Walter that he had heard my voice just
before, and Walter gave him a world of good
reasons why it was impossible, while I was standing
just behind him, as Tim might have seen,
if——But how that boy is grown! And a fine
unbroken spirit he seems to have!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And without any bitterness, Cuddie, though
the burden of affliction is laid upon him. We
may take a lesson from him: for his is not the
content of one that does not know what the blessings
are that he must forego. He tells me
sometimes what he remembers about the green
fields, and the blue river, and the star-light nights;
and if his remembrance of them seems more
beautiful than the things themselves appear to us,
this is only a proof of the greater depth of his
patience. O yes, we may take a lesson from
him!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! I thought when I saw him to-day,”
said Cuddie, setting down the candle, as if forgetting
his purpose of visiting his uncle’s bed-side,
“when I saw him sitting with his placid
face raised, and his ear intent to learn all that
was going on, I thought of the day and night
after his accident, when he was fretting and fretting,
as if it was our fault that he could not see
which neighbour it was that came to ask after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.117'>117</span>him, nor know when it was day or when it was
dark.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, before he learned to know everybody
by the voice, and to tell by the feel when the sun
was going down. It was you, Cuddie, that sat
beside him during those nights, and brought comfort
to him as often as you could step in from
your work. Did you think of that, too, when
you looked upon him this day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cuddie seized the candle again, and was going.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tim himself remembers your nursing, and
he shall not forget it, when you are no longer a
brother and a countryman. He shall never learn
from me that you were here, and left without
laying your hand upon his head, or a kiss upon
his forehead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There will be Adam to watch over him, besides
you and Walter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you, when the war is over. You will
surely come back, and ply on this very river,
and show yourself in the old port, when the cry
after deserters is over, and the press-gangs are
broken up?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never. I shall make myself altogether an
American. King George will never more have
me for a subject or a servant; and if he has me
for an enemy, by going to war with America, he
may thank his own press-gangs for it;—and not
only on account of me, but of the thousands
more that seek a home in foreign ships because
the British navy has been to them nothing better
than a prison.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cuddie was some time up stairs while Effie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.118'>118</span>hastened to pack such provisions as she had
in the house. Indifferent as her brother’s manner
was when he came down, she thought there
were signs of emotion passed away.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have not insulted his sleep, I am sure,
Cuddie? You have not breathed out ill will over
him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No: he first taught me the story of the
Prodigal Son, as I remembered when I saw his
Bible near him. Besides, I shall never see him
again.—Now, leave me to make my way over
the ferry. You had better let the boat be found
on the opposite side in the morning. They will
come hunting for me here, and you must not be
found aiding and abetting in my escape. You
will have uncle Christopher for a witness to my
not having been here; and if he should chance
to wake while you are out——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whisht! he is stirring! Hark to his step
overhead!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cuddie and his basket were past the threshold,
the door was closed, and Effie bending over her
work before uncle Christopher’s night-capped
head appeared from the stairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought I heard Walter?” said he. “I
thought Walter had come home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walter was not to be home till the middle of
the next day, the old man was reminded.</p>

<p class='c001'>So he had thought; but he had been dreaming,
it seemed to him for hours, of a weary sobbing,—the
deep sobbing of a man near him; and when
he woke up from his dream, there was a gleam
from the keyhole on the ceiling; and he next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.119'>119</span>fancied he heard whispers below, so he got up,
and partly dressed himself, and came down——</p>

<p class='c001'>“And found me just finishing my work, that
I was bent upon doing before I went to bed,”
said Effie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not going to sit up much later, child?
If you must watch, you might as well occupy your
watch with holy things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie thought of the times when Christopher
used to spend half the night in perfecting the
invention which had enabled him to gather a
good many carnal comforts about him. She
merely said that she was working for her husband.
She would just lock the chain of the boat——</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! that not done yet? I heard the chain
clank just now. Nor the door fastened, I declare!
You are a braver woman than your mother, child.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Effie did not know that she had anything to
fear. Her uncle feared rheumatism, and therefore
hastened to bed again, before she went down
to the boat with her lantern.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cuddie was just pushing himself off, and would
not heed her signs to stop. She set down her
light on the bank, and laying hold of the boat,
scrambled in, at the expense of a wetting. She
could never have forgiven his departure without
saying a final farewell. Neither of them spoke
while crossing; and it was necessary to make
haste, as some moving lights on the distant water
gave token of the approach of witnesses. The
wind blew chill, the young moon was disappearing,
and the few and faint yellow fires looked dreary
as they flickered through the darkness. Cuddie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.120'>120</span>hand had felt cold and clammy as he gave up the
oar to Effie. She had never before attempted
to deceive or mislead any one, and she dreaded
meeting uncle Christopher by daylight, as much
as if she had been abroad on a housebreaking
expedition. It would be many hours yet before
she could tell Walter; and how often might it be
her lot to hear the family and neighbours speak
of Cuddie, and to have to appear to know no
more of him than they! Then the news would
come to her mother, sooner or later, that he was
a criminal who had fled for his life. She was
very wretched.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cuddie! you are not going without one
word?” she cried, seeing him turn to step out of
the boat as it touched the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without one word he went, for no words
would come; but not without giving her some
comfort. The agony of his last embrace eased
her heart, which a light farewell would have well
nigh broken. She dwelt upon it with a strange
satisfaction as she recrossed the river; and as she
closed her doors, and put out her light to weep
in darkness till the morning; and when she related
the story to her husband; and when, long after,
they heard of the loss of Cuthbert Eldred among
others of the crew of an American merchant
vessel; and when, in subsequent years, Tim and
she used to talk of the brother Cuddie who was
the gentlest nurse and playfellow, the most
generous brother, and the bravest youth that ever
gave promise of being an honour to his class, and
an assistance to his country in her times of need.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Next day, there appeared a sufficient reason for
Mrs. Eldred’s great desire that Tim should attend
the opening of the Deep Cut. She was not
found at her old place when Walter went to
restore his charge. The cottage was shut up,
and a friendly neighbour came out to deliver to
Walter the message with which she had been entrusted
for him. Mrs. Eldred had for some time
found it difficult for her to live and maintain her
blind son, and finding that she and all her family,
except her daughter, had been impoverished by
interference with their industry in one form or
another, she had brought herself to do that which,
if free, she would have despised. She had sued
for a place in an almshouse, supported by the
vaunted charity of a corporation which caused
infinitely more want than it relieved. She had
carefully kept this secret from Walter and his
wife, knowing what efforts they would make to
preserve a proud spirit like hers from the degradation
of accepting charity. But she declared
that she felt it, though a misery, no degradation.
If the trade of the collieries was injured by a
corporation in London, so as to deprive her of
work, and if her eldest son was hindered by a
corporation nearer home from carrying his labour
to the best market, she felt that a maintenance
was due from corporative funds, and she should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.122'>122</span>receive it without any acknowledgment of obligation
till the labour of the family was once more
placed at the disposal of the family. The reproach
of the pauper dress which she and Tim must
henceforth wear must rest with those who had
prevented her earning more honourable apparel;
and she hoped her son and daughter would not
take the matter too much to heart. It appeared
that Mrs. Eldred had made these, her explanations,
very fully and not very coolly to Mr. Milford,
the surgeon, who had argued the matter
with her; not attempting to deny that her connexions
had been interfered with, but pleading
that the interference had been more for good than
for evil. But Mr. Milford liked corporations.
An idle brother of his, who had been a great
burden upon him, had been suddenly provided
for by a corporation living; and he himself was
still in possession of the Trinity House appointment
for which he had canvassed Mr. Vivian some
years before. He contended that government
had, it appeared, (contrary to his expectation,)
done a fine thing in authorizing the company to
open the Deep Cut. Everybody knew how much
rope was being manufactured there, and how much
more was wanted; and when told of the impediments
to the removal of Adam’s labour thither,
he lauded the arrangements by which Adam could
be maintained as a pauper in his native town, instead
of being left to casual charity. He insisted
much on Christopher’s prosperity;—on the
benevolence and usefulness of the interference of
government in securing to him the rewards of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.123'>123</span>ingenuity, and thus enabling him to assist his
connexions materially, if he would. Mrs. Eldred
did not impute it to the government that Christopher
did not seem more inclined to part
with his worldly wealth than if he had openly
valued as much as he professed to despise it: but
it was not the less true that Christopher’s constant
plea for economy was his expectation that
his patent would be invaded, and that he should
cease to gain by his invention, even if he were
not involved in law proceedings to defend it.
The principle of the patent law Mr. Milford
might praise unopposed; and the practical arrangements
might be improved in time; but Mrs.
Eldred could not allow it to be right that Adam
should first be made idle by an absurdly long
apprenticeship, and then kept idle by corporation
restraints; and she would not acknowledge herself
half so grateful for almshouse bounties as the
surgeon thought her in duty bound to be. Many
thanks for their charity, indeed! Mrs. Eldred
said. Many thousands in a year might they well
give away, considering how they prevented the
earning of many more thousands; but the newspapers
might as well be silent about their great
generosity: for it behoved bodies of men, as well
as individual men, to be just before they were
generous; and there was little justice in tying
a man’s hands, however liberally they might put
food into his mouth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fain would Walter and his wife have taken
home the little lad, who seemed to have small
relish for the almshouse, in anticipation or in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.124'>124</span>reality. Adam, also, from time to time during
the two years which passed before the peace,
offered to take the boy home as often as a supply
of work afforded him a home. But Mrs. Eldred
could not part with Tim; nor could Mr. Severn,
still her steady and kind friend, urge upon her a
sacrifice which would have caused her restless
mind too dangerous a leisure. When peace
came, there were many symptoms of a revived
querulousness. From the day of the general rejoicings,
which offered no charms to her, she
dropped expressions which gave as little pleasure
to everybody as to herself, about Eldred’s being
in no hurry to return home. It was a folly in
her to have ever expected it. Had he sent her a
farthing of money, from the day he went away?
It was known that he had changed his ship;—had
he come in the interval to visit her and his
children? No, no. She had heard much of the
charms of a roving life, and of naval glory; and,
doubtless, no such pleasures could be offered by
a melancholy, distressed family as he could find
in the service; and if he was looking after glory,
he would hardly return to the dull duty of taking
care of his own—a duty which his dullest neighbours
had been discharging while he was away.
She vehemently silenced poor Tim’s suggestion
that his father might not be still living. She
would listen to no excuses on Eldred’s behalf
from Effie or Adam, till the latter had recourse
to his old practice of taking his hat, and walking
away; and Effie, with her usual ingenuousness,
declared her uneasiness at hearing her father so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.125'>125</span>spoken of. The readiest way to bring her mother
round was to appear to agree with her; but Effie
could not pay the price of such disguise, even
for the pleasure of hearing her mother speak the
tenderness which lay at her heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rebuke which attends upon querulousness
more closely and constantly than upon almost
any other fault, presently arrived. Effie had
just left her in grave compassion, mixed with
displeasure; Tim was silently occupying himself
in his new art of netting; and Mrs. Eldred was
stalking about the little room, making a great
bustle to carry off her own excitement, when a
few stray words from the court-yard came in at
the open window, and made Tim quit his seat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take care, lad; you will stumble over the
chair in the middle of the room. Why cannot
you ask me for what you want?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tim steered cautiously round the chair, and
gained the lattice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s one below asking for us, mother,”
said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is impossible. You cannot tell what
they are saying below, in all the noise I am
making. There is nobody but Adam that can
be wanting us,” she continued. “I wish Adam
would choose better times for coming: he is
always sure to show himself when I am particularly
busy, and there is nothing comfortable
about us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tim thought to himself that this was rather
strange, so much complaint as he was accustomed
to hear of Adam’s coming so very seldom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.126'>126</span>and so often as it happened that his mother was
particularly busy, and had nothing comfortable
about her. He made no answer, however, being
convinced that the inquirer below was not Adam.
He presently went on,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother, can you spare a minute, just to
look out of the window at this person in the
court?”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a something in Tim’s manner that
struck her. Instead of throwing down her brush
impatiently, as he expected, she came silently,
and laid her hand on his, as trembling it grasped
the sill. She sank down on a seat after one
glance, whispering,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My boy, it is your father!”</p>

<p class='c001'>If Tim could have seen, he would not have
known his father. Instead of the black-skinned,
closely-cropped, and somewhat awful-looking
person that he remembered his father, Eldred
was now a weather-browned, blue-jacketed sailor,
with a ringlet hanging duly down either cheek,
and a little hat, which set off very favourably his
broad, round face, now a little shaded by anxiety,
but evidently meant to express a true sailor’s
joviality. Few eyes but a wife’s would have recognised
him at a first glance. A feeling of pride
in him arose as she saw him stand in the doorway;
and it tempered the bitter mortification
which, in spite of all her professions and self-deception,
she felt at being found by him in this
place.</p>

<p class='c001'>When her passion of joy and surprise was
over, and her spirits began to dance in girlish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.127'>127</span>lightness, her feelings of mortification found vent
in a few slight hints of wonder and discontent.
Eldred, with his wife beside him, Tim seated at
his feet, and in momentary expectation of Effie’s
arrival, was disposed to take such hints kindly,
though not perhaps with the fidgetty submission
which he might have shown in old times. He
had not sailed so much about the world for
nothing; nor fought so hard against the enemy
to be drilled at home, as formerly. It was easy
to be a great man to-day, his companions being
more disposed to adore his greatness than to find
any flaw in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Send you money!” said he. “Why, you
know very well that if I had had any you would
have had it all, as soon as I could send it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not mean that you have been working
all these years for nothing?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have got my wages at last; but, besides
the hardship of the wages being so much lower
than I had been accustomed to on our river,
during the war, there was the worse hardship of
our not being able to get our dues.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There would be few seamen in our colliers
if such was the practice there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And they must go on impressing for the
navy as long as it is the practice in any part of
it. Poor Cuddie! How I have been turning it
in my mind whether he would chance to be <a id='corr127.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='at!'>at</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_127.29'><ins class='correction'>at</ins></a></span>
home, or whether he would be gone to London
I never fancied his being so far out of reach.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father! were you ever flogged? Did you
ever try to desert?” inquired Tim.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.128'>128</span>“I flogged! I try to desert!” exclaimed Eldred,
amidst a painful consciousness that his indignation
at the words conveyed a reproach to
his dear, absent son. “No, Tim, I had a good
ship, and a good captain, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And went into the service with more heart
than Cuddie,” interrupted Mrs. Eldred; “and
would not give it up till the last minute, and
then were sorry to leave it for home and a dull
keel on the Tyne.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are out there, my woman. The time in
my life when I had the most mind to drown myself
was when I was stopped in my way to you, a
year and a half ago. You would not have said
much of my liking for a sea-life, if you had seen
me,—how I raved for the land as they forced me
back from it, just when I thought five minutes
more would have set me ashore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you mean? and when?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A year and a half ago, as I tell you, when I
was impressed a second time. I never cursed a
Frenchman as I cursed the boat with the infernal
gang in it that met us point blank, as we were
turning into harbour, and boarded us. Some of
the poor fellows with me let themselves out about
home. I did not, because I knew it would be of
no use; but, to be sure, one or two of them had
served as much as twelve years without seeing
their families, and my case was not so bad. But
<a id='corr128.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title=' could'>I could</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_128.30'><ins class='correction'>I could</ins></a></span> have knocked the gang overboard with
my bundle with right good-will. I hated my
bundle as much as I hated them at the moment,
because of having to take it back and unpack it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.129'>129</span>when I had put it up for home. So you never
knew I had been pressed a second time, love?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Knew it, no! If I had, I believe the law
would have been altered by this day. I would
have got all the women, injured like myself, to
go up on our knees to the king’s own presence,
and we would not have left him till we had melted
his heart, and got his promise to do away the
law.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The best of it is that the law of the land is
against impressment; it is against violence being
offered to an innocent man in any way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I suppose there is a particular law to
allow impressment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; no further than that there is a list of
those who may be legally exempted,—seamen on
special service, or protected by the proper authorities,
and so on. The marking out in this way
who is to go free, looks like countenancing the
practice; but, beyond this, the law is against the
practice. I used to insist on this, at favourable
times, but, as you may suppose, to no purpose,
owing, perhaps, in part to my endeavour to reconcile
myself to my lot. The people at home
are they that must make a stir about it. If we
pressed men manage to make ourselves tolerably
happy, we are sure to be asked, ‘Where is the
hardship?’ And if we are dull and indolent, (as
I fear poor Cuddie was, and with too much reason,)
they despise us and flog us, and ask what
the testimony of a flogged man is worth. So,
for the remedy, we must look to the people at
home; and they have, too many of them, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.130'>130</span>grievances of their own to complain of. I am
sorry indeed to find poor Adam in such an uncertain
state, now high and now low. Is it the
danger from the overseer that keeps him from
settling at the Cut?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, and reason enough. He has no notion
of putting himself at the mercy of any overseer
or churchwarden who might choose to send him
home to his parish on the mere prospect of work
falling off. The thought of it chafes me as
much as seeing Mr. Severn still no more than
Otley’s poor curate, when I know that if each
had their deserts,—if the people were allowed to
interest themselves in choosing the pastor that
would do his duty best, Mr. Severn would be one
of the first in honour and in place, and Otley (if
he had not been anywhere but in the church)
would have had to wait for a flock till he grew
as wise as the children that are now under him,
and as sober as our Adam,—and that is not supposing
much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what does Mr. Severn himself say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing about Otley; but he speaks up
for some things that I should like to see done
away. I detest the very name of a corporation,
or of any kind of meddling, after all we have
suffered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think you are wrong there. A corporation
may do many fine things, as long as it keeps
to its proper business, which is not to meddle
with industry in any way,—religious or other.
But when it is desirable that a thousand persons
should speak with one voice, and that that voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.131'>131</span>should be authority, and should go down to the
next age,—and when it is wanted to give a single
responsibility (that shall not be always changing)
to a party whose members must change, I think
a corporation is the best way of making many
into one. I mean where learning has to be
taken care of, as in the universities, or inferior
governments, like those of our great towns. But
when corporations take upon them to favour
some, and exclude others, and to fetter all that
belong to them, I will go as far as you in complaints
of them.—Walter seems the most prosperous
of you all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes: now his garden is not smoked. It
was a glad day for him and Effie when leave was
got to sell coal in London by weight. It put an
end to screening and burning. It fell out ill for
me, as everything does. But things will prosper
better now,” she continued, after a glance at her
husband’s countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me as if Effie was long in coming,”
observed Eldred. “How long will it take
you to move out of this place, when she is
once here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Move! O, not half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, you don’t suppose I mean you to stay
another hour here. Make ready to be a keel-man’s
wife again, and leave this room for some
poor creature——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That will be more thankful for it than I have
ever pretended to be. But—suppose the press-gang——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are safe till the next war; and by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.132'>132</span>time, perhaps, there may have gone up such a cry
from the whole empire as will make our rulers
man our navy with men instead of slaves. It
cannot be done in a day; but neither, I hope,
shall we go to war in a day; and if we set about
training our willing youth in time, we may have
a navy manned against the day of need as no
navy has ever yet been manned. When I was
last in the channel——Bless her dear soul, here
is Effie! And Walter behind her! And his
father too! That is what I did not expect.
Now, if we had Adam—”</p>

<p class='c001'>He stopped short, and during the silence,
many a tender thought was sent after Cuddie.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tim was the first to lead the way out of the
alms-house; and no inmate ever left it followed
by so few regrets as his mother. For her part,
having shown no gratitude while in it, she never
afterwards forgave the indignity of having been
its inhabitant, though the immediate act of becoming
so was her own.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the rest of the family, their interests
were so far from being injured by the growing
prosperity of the Deep Cut, that they all benefited
by the impetus given to trade, and the new
capital and enterprise, unfettered by legislative
interference, which it put in motion in their
neighbourhood. Their worst grievance henceforth
was when rumours of wars brought tribulation
among them. Then schemes of flight and
hiding were whispered abroad, and discussed by
the fire-side, and Tim was regarded half-enviously,
not only as usual for his virtuous cheerfulness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.133'>133</span>but for his security from the perils and woes of
impressment. There has never since been a
war, however; and it is happily yet possible that
before the day of strife shall arrive, if arrive it
must, Great Britain will have incalculably improved
her resources by rendering the service of
her sons voluntary, and their labour wholly free.</p>

  <h3 class='c020'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The duty of government being to render secure
the property of its subjects, and their industry
being their most undeniable property, all interference
of government with the direction and the
rewards of industry is a violation of its duty towards
its subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such interference takes place when some are
countenanced by legislation in engrossing labours
and rewards which would otherwise be open to
all;—as in the case of privileged trading corporations;—</p>

<p class='c001'>When arbitrary means of preparation are dictated
as a condition of the exercise of industry,
and the enjoyment of its fruits,—as in the case
of the apprenticeship law;—</p>

<p class='c001'>When labourers are compelled to a species of
labour which they would not have chosen,—as in
the case of the impressment of seamen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same duty—of securing the free exercise
of industry—requires that companies should be
privileged to carry on works of public utility
which are not within the reach of individual enterprize,—as
in the case of roads, canals, bridges,
&#38;c., and also,</p>

<p class='c001'>That the fruits of rare ingenuity and enterprize
should be secured to the individual,—according
to the design of our patent law.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.135'>135</span>In the first mentioned instances of interference,
the three great evils arise of</p>

<p class='c032'>The restraint of fair competition in some
cases;</p>

<p class='c032'>The arbitrary increase of competition in
other cases;</p>

<p class='c032'>The obstruction of the circulation of labour
and capital from employment to employment,
and from place to place.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the last mentioned instances of protection,
none of these evils take place.</p>
